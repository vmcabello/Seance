 "del_81": "Howdy'?",

 "del_89a": "I'm just kidding, relax.",

 "del_91": "In fact, Kenny did ask Lagertha to-",
 "del_91a": "Did he just ask the most powerful man in the country \nto tickle his balls?",    
 "del_92": "I heard that you were concerned about the case \nof the marked bodies!",
 "del_93": "I have already given the green light for the operation, \nand Michael will sponsor it himself!",
 "del_94": "This is all the least I could do, my father used to work \nin this Bureau when I was just a boy.",
 "del_95": "I'm glad that it is still in such good hands.",
 "del_96": "You can bet it is, sir!",
 "del_97": "And I have summoned the best detective I know to lead \nthis case, soon it will all be resolved!",

 "del_99": "Rest in pieces, Kenny's ego.",
 "del_100": "She's already on her way here, and these will \nbe her assistants!",
 "del_101": "Good to see you, Detective Kennedy!",
 "del_102": "We are ready for whatever needed!",
 "del_103": "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a flight to take to the capital, \nuntil next time!",
 "del_104": "Unfortunately, I also have a dinner with partners scheduled, \nstay well, guys.",
 "del_105": "We'd also like to excuse ourselves, we have to organize \nthe office before the boss arrives!",
 "del_106": "Uh, bye guys...",
 "del_107": "Dude, this pharma bro is kinda handsome... \nI take back what I said the other day.",
 "del_108": "Lagertha, what the hell happened here?",
 "del_109": "I know, I know...",
 "del_110": "Are you really going to bring in an outsider to lead this \ncase and put absolute rookies to assist her?",
 "del_111": "Believe it or not, but on several occasions I mentioned that you'd \nbe the best option for the case.",
 "del_112": "But the general had already decided and Michael just \nwent along with him...",
 "del_1133": "My opinion is nothing against their will!",
 "del_114": "Chill out, Kenny, we don't even know the woman, \nshe may be as good as we are!",
 "del_115": "Well, that's not why I called you here, anyway.",
 "del_116": "It's about Anna, apparently none of the interviewees \nclaim to have met or seen her.",
 "del_117": "We couldn't trace her and she doesn't appear in the theater \nrecords, maybe Miriam made this girl up?",
 "del_1172": "That's probably not the case, boss, but please keep \nus informed of what you get!",
 "del_118": "So to recap, we know Anna exists, but for some reason, \nDavi and Joe lied about her.",
 "del_119": "The agents can't find her and Lucy tried to \nbreak up with her.",
 "del_120": "Pretty darn good reasons to try a Seance using Anna's \nname, what do you say?",
 "del_121": "Agreed!",
 "del_122": "Anna is now a suspect.",
 "del_123": "In that case, let's try to find out more about this girl, maybe \nLagertha can help us.",
 "del_12300": "Not sure, we'll try to find out more about this.",
 "del_12301": "If you get any more useful info, let us know, boss!",
 "del_12302": "Leave it to me, dears!",
 "del_124": "Kenny, we got our guy, or, dunno, 99% sure we got him at least.",
 "del_125": "We should test Joe's name in a Seance, he's the best suspect we \nhave, hands down.",
 "del_126": "And thank you so much for the info, Lagertha, if you find out \nmore that can help, give me a call.",
 "del_127": "Right away, lil' boss.",
 "del_128": "Leave it to me, stay well guys!",
 "del_129": "Pull up a chair, cause' this time we have a lot to explain.",
 "del_130": "Hey dears, any news?",
 "del_130a": "Upon seeing Kennedy and Mia, Lagertha, who was talking to \na young woman, stopped speaking to address them.",
 "del_131": "And just when I thought I had seen everything in this job, \nyou guys prove me wrong again!",
 "del_132": "Then I have no one to arrest this time, but only to release!",
 "del_133": "I'll explain the situation to Miriam, Davi and all the parts \ninvolved when the case is closed!",
 "del_134": "I cannot thank you two enough, you guys are phenomenal!",
 "del_135": "This is my most anticipated moment, oh boy!",
 "del_136": "And let me take advantage of you being here to introduce the \nnew detective who just arrived!",
 "del_137": "This is Lieutenant Caroline, she's the one assigned to \ncoordinate the case of the branded bodies.",
 "del_138": "So you guys must be the famous detectives Kennedy and Mia!",
  "del_138a": "I look forward to working with you guys!",    
 "del_139": "Nice to meet you, Lieut. Caroline!",
 "del_140": "Welcome, you can count on us for whatever you need!",
 "del_141": "I'm surely going to need it, I got lost about a dozen times \nuntil I got here, hehe!",
 "del_142": "Don't worry, we can show you the city if you want.",
 "del_143": "Mia and I just finished a case, if you wanna join \nus for a coffee-",
 "del_144": "I'm sorry, I have a lot to do today, let's leave it for \nnext Wednesday, Kay'?",
 "del_145": "Now, if you'll excuse me.",
 "del_146": "Uh- \nOkay.",
 "del_147": "She's so cute, I was totally not picturing a \nlieutenant like her.",
 "del_148": "Besides, get over it, Kenny, you won't manage \nto get on her case.",
 "del_149": "I don't know what you're talking about, I was just \nbeing courteous to my colleague!",
 "del_150": "I know you well enough to know your intentions, you mole.",
 "del_15000": "Either you are hitting on her or trying to get \non her case, which is it?",
 "del_15001": "Hmm, maybe both?",
 "del_15002": "You're hopeless.",
 "del_151": "Anyway, let's call this a day, take me to the premium \noutlet, I need my new skin care!",
 "del_152": "And there's this Miguel Chors purse that I'm dying to \nbuy and also that new dress from-",
 "del_153": "There you go again, spending the entire salary in two hours.",
 "del_154": "But today you deserve it, and I need some new \nunderwear too, let's go!",
 "del_155": "We arrested the suspect in his own home, the dagger used \nin the crime was in his possession.",
 "del_156": "It was seized along with the branding iron used to leave \nthe marks on the victims' skins.",
 "del_157": "For you who have just arrived, we are with the detective \nwho's leading the case of the marked bodies!",
 "del_158": "Caroline continues to talk more about the operation.",
 "del_159": "Wait, what?",
 "del_160": "Isn't that great? \nLieutenant Caroline caught the culprit in less than a week!",
 "del_161": "He is a local farmer called Ludwig, he's being detained \nuntil the case is closed.",
 "del_162": "And you thought she couldn't handle it, Kenny.",
 "del_163": "I highly do- \nUh, leave this for later.",
 "del_164": "What do you have for us about Condor, boss?",
 "del_165": "As you asked, the cottage's owner, Rupert Norton, \nis ready for questioning!",
 "del_166": "About Don, he was found and arrested after the money briefcases \nwere found, he's also available to be interrogated.",
 "del_167": "Let's see what we can get here, Mia.",
 "del_168": "Don Cappelletti",
 "del_169": "Rupert Norton",
 "del_170": "Return to the woods",
 "del_171": "Let's see what we can get here, Mia.",
 "del_172": "Hey Mia, wait.",
 "del_173": "Before jumping back to the case, I'd like to have a talk \nwith Caroline.",
 "del_174": "Wait here with Lagertha, okay?",
 "del_175": "Shesh, what did lieutenant do to deserve you?",
 "del_176": "Fine, be quick because the place is far enough.",
 "del_177": "So, have you watched the last season of Cracking Bad?",
 "del_178": "Oh my God, yes!",
 "del_179": "That was definitely the series of the year!",
 "del_180": "And this is why, in my opinion, Valter Black did \nnothing wrong at all.",
 "del_181": "And also why his wife and partner acted like two \npricks halfway through the series!",
 "del_182": "The first time, I found his wife annoying, too. \nBut when I watched it again, I realized she was right!",
 "del_183": "She married Valter to build a family, not to become \na drug dealer, after all.",
 "del_184": "If there was a hysteric, annoying character, \nthen it was her sister!",
 "del_185": "Yeah, right?",
 "del_186": "The door of Caroline's office suddenly opens.",
 "del_187": "Thanks for the tips, but the next time I need an amateur opinion, \nI'll make a post on Reddit.",
 "del_188": "Yeah, have a good day, lieutenant.",
 "del_189": "Kennedy slams the door shut.",
 "del_190": "Smooth as always, Kenny!",
 "del_191": "As if I needed her help for anything.",
 "del_192": "It seems that things didn't go too well in there, huh? ♥",
 "del_193": "*Takes a deep breath* \nJust... Let's get back to the case, Okay?",
 "del_194": "We're done here for now.",
 "del_195": "Aye, sir!",
 "del_196": "That will be everything for now, thanks for your help, boss!",
 "del_197": "You guys are welcome, hope to hear from you soon.",
 "del_198": "See ya!",
 "del_199": "Hey boss, an agent said you had something to say?",
 "del_200": "Oh, you're here already.",
 "del_201": "Well, this certainly won't be easy for me to say, but...",
 "del_202": "I received this call from the capital a few minutes ago.",
 "del_203": "And I'll have to withdraw you from Condor's case, \nKennedy, I'm so sorry.",
 "del_204": "Please hand me your badge.",
 "del_205": "What the hell?!",
 "del_206": "This is complete madness! \nWe're halfway through the case, you can't do that!",
 "del_207": "I'm sorry, Mia, it was orders from above, I'm just doing \nwhat I was told to do.",
 "del_208": "You can stay on the case if you feel comfortable, \nwhat I have been told concerns Kennedy only.",
 "del_209": "That's unfair, if he leaves the case, then I'll leave too. \nI don't care-.",
 "del_210": "Hey, Mia, chill.",
 "del_211": "I can't say I loved this outcome, but I won't act like \nI didn't expect it, either.",
 "del_212": "Kennedy took the badge from his suit pocket and handed it to Lagertha.",
 "del_213": "Lagertha, just tell me this: Who gave you this order?",
 "del_214": "I'm sorry dear, but that's classified information.",
 "del_215": "It's cool, I already know that, I was just hoping \nto confirm it from you.",
 "del_216": "Kenny, you better start explaining everything to me, \nI'm sick with all these secrets!",
 "del_217": "What the hell did you say to Caroline?",
 "del_218": "All I can say for now is that you should stay away \nfrom lieutenant, she can't be trusted!",
 "del_219": "I am about to solve a big case, and the phone call \nboss received just confirms it!",
 "del_220": "I can't give any more details because I don't want \nto drag you and Lagertha into this!",
 "del_221": "Can't you just tell me at once?",
 "del_222": "I just wanna help you, I'm your partner, damn it!",
 "del_223": "If you wanna help me, stay on the Condor case, \nwe are really close to finishing it!",
 "del_224": "This will be the first case that you will solve \nby yourself, aren't you excited?",
 "del_225": "Well, I kinda am, to be honest.",
 "del_226": "But even though it pains me to admit it, I really \nneed your help to finish the case! ",
 "del_227": "I am still inexperienced in investigations, \nso I don't know if I can do it...",
 "del_228": "You are totally capable, you just need to \nbelieve in yourself more!",
 "del_229": "Besides, a helping hand can be provided, \nright, Lagertha?",
 "del_230": "But of course, I will find a competent partner \nto help Mia finish the case!",
 "del_231": "Not as competent as me, of course.",
 "del_232": "Well then, I'll leave Mia in your hands, Boss.",
 "del_234": "I'll take her under my wing, don't worry!",
 "del_235": "And one last thing, don't tell anyone what \nI told you two here, alright?",
 "del_236": "You don't have a thing to worry, dear!",
 "del_237": "Now I have a few things to take care of, \nif you ladies will excuse me.",
 
 "del_239": "Right, have fun there, Kenny.",
 "del_240": "Sorry about all this, are you good to continue, dear?",
 "del_241": "Yeah, don't worry, I can do this!",
 "del_242": "Awesome, we got Jean, the supposed hitman. \nHe had just been arrested when Kenny called!",
 "del_2421": "Some witnesses saw Gregory leaving this man's \napartment in a hurry yesterday!",
 "del_2421a": "And the agents found an arsenal of weapons with \nthe serial number scratched off in there.",    
 "del_2422": "Jean is ready for questioning!",
 "del_243": "Ugh-. \nActually, I don't know if I can do this.",
 "del_244": "What do you mean by that?",
 "del_245": "I never lead an interrogation before, what if I stutter or \nget too nervous to speak?",
 "del_246": "Don't worry, dear, I'm sure you'll do just fine.",
 "del_247": "If you need anything, I'll be here, just call me!",
 "del_248": "While you're in there, I'm going to look for your new assistant!",
 "del_249": "Good luck!",

 "del_252": "''Morning, my name's Mia and I'm here today to interview you.'' \nCan't be hard, right?",
 "del_253": "Let's do this!",
 "del_254": "Ma'am, here's your coffee, newspaper and doughnuts, \ndo you need anything else?",
 "del_255": "Thank you, espresso fetcher!",
 "del_256": "You have come at a good time, tell me, would you \nlike a promotion?",
 "del_257": "Woah chief, that'd be an honor!",
 "del_258": "Great, then I promote you to field agent, you'll assist \nMia in her case.",
 "del_259": "Who's that?",
 "del_260": "It's the girl who solves cases with Kennedy, you know?",
 "del_261": "Ah, yes, I'm really grateful for your proposal.",
 "del_262": "But perhaps it'd be more appropriate for you to recruit a \nreal field agent for this, no?",
 "del_263": "I mean, I'm from the accounting department.",
 "del_264": "You'll do just fine, grab a badge and follow the girl, \nshe'll manage the rest on her own.",
 "del_265": "Hey Lagertha, I'm done!",
 "del_266": "Hi dear, I was watching you the whole time!",
 "del_267": "You did great, I'm so proud of you!",
 "del_268": "Huh, but we were here the whol-",
 "del_269": "Shut up, you.",
 "del_270": "Really?! \nThanks a lot!",
 "del_271": "Yeah, and let me introduce you to your new \nassistant, meet Agent...",
 "del_272": "Sorry, what's your name again?",
 "del_273": "My name's Agent Kim, it's an honor working with an intern \nof the great detective Kennedy!",
 "del_274": "Hello, my name's Mia and I hate you already!",
 "del_275": "I need you to forbid him to approach the suspect \nagain under any circumstances!",
 "del_276": "No worries, will do it.",
 "del_277": "Oh hey, Mia, how are you doing?",
 "del_278": "I'm so sorry to hear about Kennedy, if you need anything just-.",
 "del_279": "Yeah, I'm not in the mood to talk to you, Lieutenant.",
 "del_280": "I understand that you may be angry, but this was simply \na disciplinary matter.",
 "del_281": "Kennedy needs to learn his place here, I am sure he'll \nnot commit the same mistake twice.",
 "del_282": "Now I need to finish my forms to close this case, \nthanks for the help, Lagertha!",
 "del_283": "You're welcome, Lieutenant!",
 "del_284": "Dude, I don't like this woman one bit.",
 "del_285": "Julie mentioned that the suspect was summoned \nfor the interview.",
 "del_286": "Is the man already here at the station, boss?",
 "del_287": "Yup, Kale has already given his testimony, do you want \nme to tell you more about him?",
 "del_288": "Interrogate him",
 "del_289": "Ask about him",
 "del_290": "Nah, we're fine, Julie has already drawn \nthe situation for me.",
 "del_291": "If that's the case, good luck!",
 "del_292": "Just who's this guy?",
 "del_293": "Following Kenny's tip, we did a little social media investigation.",
  "del_293a": "We found out that Margot was close to two men who were fans \nof the capricorns at the time!",    
 "del_294": "Her father, who has been living in Brazil for two years, \nand her boyfriend, some sort of rock star.",
 "del_295": "It's the latter that is here today.",
 "del_296": "He has already declared an alibi, but you'd better \nask him yourself.",
 "del_297": "Excuse me, Miss Mia, I brought your earring.",
 "del_298": "Hey, that's al-",
 "del_299": "Wait, what?",
 "del_300": "Is there something wrong, miss?",
 "del_301": "Ugh, no! \nThank you so much for finding it!",
 "del_302": "What?!",
 "del_303": "Whaaaaaaaat-.",
 "del_304": "We're going back to the woods now, thanks!",
 "del_305": "Good luck there, dear!",
 "del_306": "Holy shit, I lost 180 dollars!!!",  
 "cp2_2": "Can't we have a normal convo for 20 minutes, like, at least once?",
 "cp2_3": "Whatever, we are here, let's look for Lagertha.",
 "cp2_4": "And that is how one guy, eating a bat, led to a toilet paper \nshortage in the United States.",
 "cp2_5": "What a crazy movie, this'd never happen in real life!",
 "cp2_7": "And do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder in France?",
 "cp2_8": "Go get the man, I believe in you, Kenny!",
 "cp2_9": "You could do something to help, you know.",
 "cp2_10": "I'm sending my strongest thoughts and prayers for you!",
 "cp2_11": "*Gasps*",
 "cp2_12": "Balls, that guy hits hard!",
 "cp2_13": "That's totally working out, Kenny, keep doing it.",
 "cp2_14": "That's irony, by the way.",
 "cp2_15": "So come and try to hold him down yourself, you little twat.",
 "cp2_16": "He's definitely tired now, this is my chance.",
 "cp2_17": "Stop resisting!",
 "cp2_18": "Look who just woke up, rise and shine sunflower.",
 "cp2_19": "What just happened?",
 "cp2_20": "You got knocked out by our friend Joe Badger here, \nbut we managed to calm him down.",
 "cp2_21": "The guy who used to stalk Lucy?",
 "cp2_22": "The guy himself.",
 "cp2_23": "Finally good news, let's forget what just happened here \ntoday, okay?",
 "cp2_24": "Of course I'll not forget this, it was too hilarious!",
 "cp2_25": "Now how about talking to him?",
 "cp2_26": "The door to the theater's dressing room.",
 "cp2_27": "Use Locker Room Key to unlock it?",
 "cp2_28": "Balls, we need to look for the keys.",
 "cp2_29": "Kennedy inserted the key into the lock and unlocked the door.",
 "cp2_30": "Neat, let's get in, Mia.",
 "cp2_31": "What the hell!?",
 "cp2_32": "Who's that guy? What the hell?!",
 "cp2_33": "      Le-let me out of he-here!",
 "cp2_34": "Guys, block the exit, don't let the man escape!",
 "cp2_35": "Go get him, Kenny!",
 "cp2_36": "I know, get back, Mia.",
 "cp2_37": "Boy, I must record this.",
 "cp2_38": "Wow, cool place, are you gonna watch a play or \nsomething?",
 "cp2_39": "Nay, we're just doing an investigation here.",
 "cp2_40": "Good, theaters are boring as hell.",
 "cp2_41": "You'll want to take a peek into that room over there, \nthere's some crazy stuff going on there!",
 "cp2_42": "What kind of stuff?",
 "cp2_43": "There's no fun telling you that, I wanna see \nwhat'll happen!",
 "cp2_44": "You gotta quit being like this, Ellen.",
 "cp2_45": "Not that I noticed!",
 "cp2_46": "Ellen, is it true that our mind transcends \nin the afterlife?",
 "cp2_47": "But hey, I think I solved the Yang–Mills existence and mass gap theorem! \nWe can say that the theory has a mass gap if the two-point \nfunction has the property- ",

 "cp2_49": "Hey, I was beginning to think you guys wouldn't come!",
 "cp2_50": "These are my lucky socks, I need to wear them to solve cases.",
 "cp2_51": "You can thank my partner, who spent almost an hour looking \nfor his ugly rainbow socks!",
 "cp2_52": "Seriously man, where did you get these hideous things, Wish?",
 "cp2_52a": "It was a present... \nFrom this guy I like to call my dead father...",
 "cp2_52b": "Oh my, I'm sorry, I didn't know...",
  "cp2_52c": "Just kidding, I ordered these bad boys while \ndrunk last month.",

 "cp2_53": "Sorry to interrupt, but could you guys find a killer for me?",
 "cp2_53a": "What you got for us here, boss?",
 "cp2_54": "This one is rather bizarre, so pay attention.",
 "cp2_55": "Ever heard about the hollywood actress Lucy Johnson?",
 "cp2_56": "The girl who was cast in Spirit Shell?",
 "cp2_57": "She's so gorgeous that I almost didn't care the \nmovie was such a bad adaptation.",
 "cp2_58": "It's true, though. You should read the manga, it's much better!",
 "cp2_59": "Why was I expecting for you to say something like this?",
 "cp2_60": "Affirmative, that's Lucy right under the covers.",
 "cp2_61": "No way, what the hell happened?",
 "cp2_62": "That's what I am hoping for you guys to explain.",
 "cp2_63": "This is the theater where Lucy was rehearsing recently, \nit seems that she was on vacation here.",
 "cp2_63a": "At eleven o'clock, her colleagues came back from the street Bistro.",

 "cp2_6444": "They claim that the theater Director was the only one in the \ntheater, besides Lucy.",
 "cp2_6445": "Soon after, they called the police.",     
 "cp2_65": "Who else was there?",
 "cp2_66": "Where's the Director?",
 "cp2_67": "Was Lucy all by herself on the stage?",
"cp2_68": "Her colleagues were having dinner with the Director in a \nBistro after rehearsing.",
 "cp2_6888": "They said that, for some reason, Davi came back before \neveryone else to the theater.",
 "cp2_70": "Wish I was motivated like that.",
 "cp2_71": "You said the Director was already at the crime scene?",
 "cp2_7111": "Where's the guy right now?",
 "cp2_72": "The Director, Davi Constantine, claimed to be the first to find her body.",
 "cp2_7222": "But due to the dubious circumstances, he has been referred \nto the DBI, in case you wish to speak with him.",
 "cp2_73": "So we already have a suspect, let's talk to the guy-",
 "cp2_6446": "What would you like to know?",    
 "cp2_74": "You gotta do a Seance with Davi's name, Mia!",
 "cp2_75": "Excuse me?",
 "cp2_76": "Do you take pleasure in wasting my Seances?",
 "cp2_77": "Because you do a heck of a good job at it!",
 "cp2_78": "It's fantastic to start an investigation assuring  \nthat a prime suspect is inno.",
 "cp2_79": "This way, we can talk to the guy knowing that he's \nprobably telling us the truth!",
 "cp2_80": "At best, we find the culprit right off the bat, at worst, \nwe get someone we can trust!",
 "cp2_8788": "I'm not sure how you do that medium stuff, Mia, but he seems \nto have a point.",
 "cp2_8144": "Even you, Lagertha?",
 "cp2_81": "Dude, but what if this attempt would be useful \nto us later?",
 "cp2_82": "Tell me, Mia, how many times have we failed a case?",
 "cp2_83": "Uh, zero.",
 "cp2_84": "And how many times have I been wrong before?",
 "cp2_85": "A lot, actually, but I'll give your crazy strategy a chance.",
 "cp2_86": "That's what I like to hear, let's go!",
 "cp2_87": "Can I help you guys?",
 "cp2_88": "We are good for now, we will just take a look at the body.",
 "cp2_89": "Right, I'm here if you need.",
 "cp2_90": "Excuse us, chief, mind if we talk to her real quick?",
 "cp2_91": "Of course, you guys must be in a hurry!",

 "cp2_101": "Yeah, he can be trusted, let's talk to him.",

 "cp2_106": "Yup!",
 "cp2_107": "Okay, we'll be there in a minute.",

 "cp2_115": "Okay.",
 "cp2_116": "Perhaps I'll need to change my underwear.",
 "cp2_117": "Boy, if that had fallen six inches to the left... \nYou'd have to do a seance on my dead body to continue the case!",
 "cp2_118": "Are you hurt, Mia? \nWhat were these cat-like reflexes of yours?",
 "cp2_120": "Actually, it was that dark silhouette that pushed me.",
 "cp2_121": "The one that used to visit you and Ellen before I rescued you?",
 "cp2_122": "Yup, that's him.",
 "cp2_123": "???: What happened to the cute name you used \nto call me when you were younger?",
 "cp2_124": "???: By the way, that was the fifteenth time I saved you, \nyou’re welcome.",
 "cp2_125": "That's right, I'm sorry Bob, and thank you so much again!",
 "cp2_126": "Hey, everything okay up there?",
 "cp2_127": "Don't worry, boss, we're alive.",
 "cp2_128": "Good, I'm sorry about that, I'll have some agents clean \nthis mess later.",

 "cp2_129": "Hey, are you guys all right over there?",
 "cp2_130": "Don't worry, friend, we're fine.",
 "cp2_131": "Bob: I have to go now, take care, kiddo!",
 "cp2_132": "Until next time, Bob!",

 "cp2_383": "I'm li-like her number one fan, man, eve-verything \nI did was out of pure admiration!",
 "cp2_384": "You crossed some boundaries with this \nadmiration thing, dude.",
 "cp2_385": "So you admit you were in this theater when the \nmurder took place?",
 "cp2_386": "Gosh, when they fi-finished rehearsing, Lucy came towards the \nlocker room and I pa-panicked and ran to hide.",
 "cp2_387": "After that, they lo-locked me in there, I di-didn't \ndo anything to Lucy, I lo-loved her!",
 "cp2_388": "I love Madonna too, but that's not an excuse for \nme to stalk her, pal.",
 "cp2_389": "Also not an excuse for you to sing ''Miles Away'' \nevery time it plays on the radio!",
 "cp2_390": "You suck at singing, dude.",
 "cp2_391": "Even though you were locked back there, you must have \nwitnessed something, tell us what you got.",

 "cp2_395": "The door has a window, do you wanna tell me you \ndidn't notice it?",
 "cp2_397": "I pa-panicked when I he-heard her screams, it took me \na while to che-check what was going on.",
 "cp2_398": "But it wa-was useless, the window is frosted, I saw \nno-nothing but Lucy's silhouette.",
 "cp2_399": "He's right, it's a locker room, of course the \nwindow would not be transparent.",
 "cp2_400": "Lucy's colleagues heard screams coming from this stage, \nthere's no way you didn't hear anything being so close!",
 "cp2_401": "Yeah, I he-heard screams followed by an u-uproar co-coming from \nthe stage.",
 "cp2_402": "But I-I only heard Lucy's voice, I'm no-not lying to you, I have \nno reason to do so!",
 "cp2_403": "We have no choice but to believe in his words right now.",
 "cp2_404": "Since I'm talking to a Lucy's stalker, would you know if \nshe had contact with a girl named Anna?",
 "cp2_405": "She is one of the actresses in this theater.",
 "cp2_406": "During the re-rehearsals I-I never saw the Director \naddress a, uhm, girl by the na-name Anna!",
 "cp2_407": "During the rehearsals?",
 "cp2_408": "Just how many have you been watching?",
 "cp2_409": "More than I-I'm proud to admit...",
 "cp2_410": "Well, that backs up Davi's testimony.",
 "cp2_411": "Then Miriam was lying about Anna, but why?",
 "cp2_412": "The more we find out, the less we seem to know.",
 "cp2_413": "That's enough for now, please take him to the station.",
    "cp2_413a": "Joe, you were as helpful as nun's ovaries, thanks!",

 "cp2_439": "From the looks of it, Jenn took all the money she \ngot from Jennacon and fled the country!",

 "cp2_447": "I'm not sure if it was the journals or the move from Mom's \nhouse, but I'm doing much better!",

 "cp2_449": "           Oh no, what a terrible ti-time to have rhinitis.",

 "cp2_464": "I'll be back before the others, to bring you some \nof that Caesar Salad you like!",
 "cp2_465": "Thanks, Davi, I mean it!",
 "cp2_466": "That was close, I need to stop bringing these journals \nwith me before someone gets them!",

 "cp3_37": "He had two stab wounds in his chest, an axe wound in his back \nand a bear trap wound in his left leg.",

 "cp3_42": "You wouldn't stand a chance against me, let's be real.",
 "cp3_43": "A damn bear trap, eh... \nAre we in a hunting ground?",
 "cp3_44": "If the killer is a hunter, he’s acting illegally, \nthis forest is part of a preservation area!",

 "cp3_46": "Do you already have a suspect or a name to help us?",
 "cp3_47": "Yes, we identified the owner of the cottage where the \nconflict took place.",
 "cp3_48": "His name is... \nLet me check again in the spreadsheet...",

 "cp3_53": "Hmm, Ok for me!",
 "cp3_5333": "If we finish here early, we can catch the 10 PM \nscreening, how about it? ",

 "cp3_5335": "Told you, that's called chivalry-",
 "cp3_54": "Do you have any hints that can help, traces left \nbehind, perhaps?",
 "cp3_55": "Yes, a lot of blood was found inside the cottage to \nthe west, probably where the fight started.",
 "cp3_56": "In addition we found the bear trap used in the crime, \nit was in front of said cottage!",
 "cp3_57": "We also found several footprints of both the victim and the \nmurderer in the mud of the clearing up there!",
 "cp3_58": "Nah, she was probably just feeling guilty after rejecting you \na bazillion times.",
 "cp3_59": "Now then, how about we start Seancing with this Rupert guy?",
 "cp3_60": "If you want me to go after any suspects for you guys, \ngive me a call!",

 "cp3_79": "Read my book and you will understand, \nit is 30% off at amaz-",
 "cp3_80": "Woah, why do I even bother asking stuff.",
 "cp3_81": "Lagertha wasn't kidding, what is this godforsaken place?",
 "cp3_82": "No idea, I just used Waze to get here.",

 "cp3_114": "Woah, someone in this place that has the good sense to carry a gun!",
 "cp3_115": "Why do they hire kids and wimps like that to be \ndetectives?",

 "cp3_117": "I don't freaking know!",

 "cp3_130": "He's knocked out back at the cottage, Caroline \nwent to see the guy!",
 "cp3_131": "How lucky we had her around today, right?",
 "cp3_132": "That's what I wanted to know, to be honest...",

 "cp3_141": "And...",
 "cp3_142": "I'd never have imagined that something like this \ncould happen, seriously...",
 "cp3_143": "I should have come with you, even though I was \ndismissed from the case.",
 "cp3_144": "Well, maybe next time just stick with our cas-",
 "cp3_145": "Forget it, just where have you been all this time, dude?",
 "cp3_146": "Good question.",
 "cp3_147": "What do you mean by that?",
 "cp3_148": "The only thing I remember...",
 "cp3_149": "Is that I went to solve a case after Lagertha dismissed me!",

 "cp3_1566": "I'll leave that for another day, I'm not feeling 100% yet.",
 "cp3_1567": "They must've hit you real hard on the head \nfor you to say that.",

 "cp3_161": "My bad! \nHehe-",
 "cp3_162": "Aye, we just tried a Seance with a name that doesn't exist.",

 "cp3_164": "Sorry about that.",
 "cp3_165": "I learn from the mistakes of people who took my advice.",
 "cp3_166": "That explains all of your wit.",

 "cp3_178": "I think there's something buried here.",
 "cp3_179": "Huh- \nWhy do you say that?",
 "cp3_180": "Only in this area there are no underbrush, it was replanted, \nbut the rain washed it away.",

 "cp3_220": "That's our guy!",
 "cp3_221": "It would have been a valuable interrogation lesson... \nToo bad I had to look for your earring...",
 "cp3_222": "Yeah, too bad!",

 "cp4_19": "Aye, good call, dude!",
 "cp4_20": "Mia crossed her legs and sat in a comfortable position, and with \nan expression overflowing with happiness, began to explain.",

 "cp4_22": "First, I'll describe a mysterious situation, then you have to try \nto find out what's going on by asking me questions. ",
 "cp4_23": "The rules are simple: I can only answer your \nquestions with ''yes'' or ''no''. ",
 "cp4_24": "You need to figure out the mystery by asking me a maximum \nof ten questions!",
 "cp4_25": "So, what do you say?",
 "cp4_26": "Play it",
 "cp4_27": "Ask for rules again",
 "cp4_28": "Alright, bring it on.",

 "cp4_30": "Now you're just messing with me, right?",
 "cp4_31": "Just explain it to me again, we have loads of time anyway.",
 "cp4_32": "Okay, let me think of a nice one.",
 "cp4_33": "Do the one with the pheasant!",
 "cp4_34": "That one's neat, but let's start with an easier one.",
 "cp4_35": "I remembered one, here it goes:",
 "cp4_36": "You're in the middle of a desert, where you find a man lying \non the ground.",
 "cp4_37": "Upon close inspection, you notice that the man is dead and naked, \nwith a stick near his outstretched hand.",
 "cp4_38": "Because you've just described the morning after my grad party.",
 "cp4_39": "Would the man be me, by any chance?",
 "cp4_40": "Don't break my game's vibe, asshat.",
 "cp4_41": "First question:",
 "cp4_42": "Hmm, give me a minute.",
 "cp4_43": "Murder?",
 "cp4_44": "Accident?",
 "cp4_45": "Suicide?",
 "cp4_46": "Was this man murdered by someone?",
 "cp4_47": "Was this man's death an accident?",
 "cp4_48": "Let's say yes.",
 "cp4_49": "Did this guy kill himself in the story?",
 "cp4_50": "Negative.",
 "cp4_51": "Second question",
 "cp4_52": "How did he get there?",
 "cp4_53": "Why was he naked?",
 "cp4_54": "How the hell did the guy end up there?",
 "cp4_55": "Yes or no questions, dude, yes or no!",
 "cp4_56": "Did he get there by any means of transport?",
 "cp4_57": "Yes!",
 "cp4_58": "Did he take off his clothes because the desert was hot?",
 "cp4_59": "No, and that'd be worse because of the insolation, by the way.",
 "cp4_60": "Sorry, you little Clerk Maxwell.",
 "cp4_61": "Third question:",
 "cp4_62": "Okay, I'm getting the spirit of this game.",
 "cp4_63": "Did he arrive by air?",
 "cp4_64": "Did he arrive by land?",
 "cp4_65": "Did he get to the desert by air?",
 "cp4_66": "Affirmative!",
 "cp4_67": "Did he get to the desert by land?",
 "cp4_68": "No, sir.",
 "cp4_69": "Fourth question",
 "cp4_70": "So, about the way of transport.",
 "cp4_71": "Was it a plane?",
 "cp4_72": "Was it a helicopter?",
 "cp4_73": "Was it a balloon?",
 "cp4_74": "Was it a hang glider?",
 "cp4_75": "Did he get to the desert by plane?",
 "cp4_76": "Nope!",
 "cp4_77": "Did he get to the desert by helicopter?",
 "cp4_78": "Nope!",
 "cp4_79": "Just a wild guess: The guy rode a hot air balloon?",
 "cp4_80": "Yeah!",
 "cp4_81": "Just a wild guess: He got there using a hang glider?",
 "cp4_82": "Too wild of a guess, try again.",
 "cp4_83": "Fifth question",
 "cp4_84": "I better ask about the balloon accident now.",
 "cp4_85": "Punctured?",
 "cp4_86": "Caught fire?",
 "cp4_87": "Was the balloon punctured by any chance?",
 "cp4_88": "Did the burner set the balloon on fire?",
 "cp4_89": "Sixth question",
 "cp4_90": "Now, as for the circumstances of the accident.",
 "cp4_91": "Was he alone?",
 "cp4_92": "Was he the cause?",
 "cp4_93": "Was the guy among a group of people there?",
 "cp4_94": "Yeah, sir!",
 "cp4_95": "Did he throw himself from up there because his friends made \nhim play this game?",
 "cp4_96": "No, and I'll count this as a question, you jerk.",
 "cp4_97": "Well, damn.",
 "cp4_98": "Was the guy the cause of the accident?",
 "cp4_99": "That's actually irrelevant.",
 "cp4_100": "Eighth question:",
 "cp4_101": "Ok, so the guy was in a group traveling across the \ndesert in a hot-air balloon.",
 "cp4_102": "It was punctured and began to lose altitude, which'd \nexplain why the guy was naked:",
 "cp4_103": "To get comfortable",
 "cp4_104": "To relieve weight",
 "cp4_105": "Did he take his clothes off to get comfortable around his bros?",
 "cp4_106": "No, dude, you were doing so well, how could you conclude \nsomething so stupid?",
 "cp4_107": "They needed to reduce the weight in the basket, so they \nall took off their clothes, right?",
 "cp4_108": "Yes, boy!",
 "cp4_109": "Ninth question:",
 "cp4_110": "Which would also explain why the guy fell:",
 "cp4_111": "To relieve weight",
 "cp4_112": "He was forced out",
 "cp4_113": "He slipped?",
 "cp4_114": "The balloon continued to fall, so in a desperate decision to \nreduce weight, the guy jumped.",
 "cp4_115": "Exactly!",
 "cp4_116": "There was an argument between the group, so they ended up \nthrowing the guy out of the balloon?",
 "cp4_117": "Not even close.",
 "cp4_118": "Did the guy slip and fall off the balloon?",
 "cp4_119": "Last question:",
 "cp4_120": "What about the stick?",
 "cp4_121": "It was for a bet",
 "cp4_122": "It was an accident",
 
 "cp4_124": "So to recap, the guy was traveling across the desert in a hot \nair balloon.",
 "cp4_125": "It was punctured and began to lose altitude, which made the \ngroup throw stuff out of the balloon to reduce weight.",
 "cp4_126": "Including their own clothes.",
 "cp4_127": "The balloon continued to fall anyway, so in a desperate decision \nto reduce weight, the guy jumped.",
 "cp4_128": "Actually, it was a decision made by drawing sticks, the guy lost \nby drawing the smallest stick, so he was chosen to jump.",
 "cp4_129": "Yay, you nailed the mystery!",
 "cp4_130": "He could work like this in our cases at least once.",
 "cp4_131": "Hmm, did he accidentally grab the stick?",
 "cp4_132": "Not even close.",
 "cp4_133": "You have exceeded your 10 attempts.",
 "cp4_134": "Too bad that you already used your ten questions, \nso you lost, good game!",
 "cp4_135": "At least tell me the resolution of the puzzle.",
 "cp4_136": "There's no fun if I do this, but you can try to start over, how \nabout it?",
 "cp4_137": "Play again",
 "cp4_138": "I'm fine",
 "cp4_139": "Alright, let's try this again.",
 "cp4_140": "Nope, try again.",
 "co_1": "Kennedy approached the agent and showed his badge.",
 "co_2": "Morning', I'm detective Kennedy Leaves. \nWe have been called by the DBI to investigate the murder!",

 "co_341": "I'm gonna start calling you that.",
 "co_342": "I'm still hungover and I'm not in the \nmood for your games.",
 "co_343": "Besides, it's never one's priority to come testify when \ntheir own father dies.",
 "co_344": "Except when you're the main suspect of \nkilling your father, Charles.",
 "co_345": "Ammo capsules from YOUR gun were found at the \ncrime scene alongside to YOUR car.",
 "co_346": "I wouldn't want to be in your shoes right now. \nIf you go to a popular jury it'll be your end!",
 "co_347": "What, you said my gun was used!?",
 "co_348": "Oh, they didn't tell you yet?",
 "co_349": "The agents are pretty sure that you are the killer. \nThe case's almost closed.",
 "co_350": "Hey, what's with this bluff?",
 "co_351": "Just play along with me.",
 "co_352": "That was the stupidest thing I've ever heard, someone else may \nvery well have used my stuff.",
 "co_353": "I was wasted last night, I just woke up in the middle of \nthis shitshow and now I'm here.",
 "co_354": "Whether you believe me or not, that doesn't change the facts, \nleave the rest to my lawyers.",
 "co_355": "Pressure him",
 "co_356": "Comfort him",
 "co_357": "Cut the crap, we have evidence that it was you, tell us \neverything we need to know!",
 "co_358": "The more you mislead us, the worse it'll be for you, got it?!",
 "co_359": "What the hell's wrong with you, we DO KNOW that \nit was not him!",
 "co_360": "What do you mean you guys know it?",
 "co_361": "Now you did it.",
 "co_362": "What I was doing is called ''Futility Technique'', \nit's a proven method and you just ruined it.",
 "co_363": "Sheesh, he's already looking frightened enough.",
 "co_364": "Charles, we know you are super confused and everything.",
 "co_365": "But please, try to help us find the real culprit.",
 "co_366": "Do this for your father!",
 "co_367": "How can you be so sure that I'm innocent when everyone else \nassumes otherwise?",
 "co_368": "Oh, I... \nUhm...",
 "co_369": "By your micro-expressions, I study a lot of psychology, \nI know when people are telling the truth!",
 "co_370": "Girl, I think that you are watching too much ''Lie to me''.",
 "co_371": "But you are right, I didnt' kill my father and I can \nanswer some questions, if that helps.",
 "co_372": "See, this is called ''Not-being-an-asshole technique''.",
 "co_373": "Ok, now zip it.",
 "co_374": "Yeah, we know that it was not you, it's like I said, \nwe are here to help you.",
 "co_375": "You guys... Know it?",
 "co_376": "I mean, I know I'm innocent, but how can you be so sure \nwhen everyone thinks the opposite?",
 "co_377": "You might not believe me, but this girl over here has a skill \nthat let us know if a person is lying or not.",
 "co_378": "Is she a human polygraph or something like that?",
 "co_379": "Pretty much, so don't lie to us or we'll know it \nright away, Ok?",
 "co_380": "Help us getting the real culprit so we can all go home, dude.",
 "co_381": "Alright, now that we're settled:",
 "co_382": "About the car",
 "co_383": "About the deposit",
 "co_384": "About Bruno",
 "co_385": "Your SUV was found at the crime scene, how could \nthe killer have had access to your car? ",
 "co_386": "My keys were on my bedside table when I went to sleep, \nbut the next morning they were gone!",
 "co_387": "Were there any signs of a break-in at your door?",
 "co_388": "No, the front door was intact.",
 "co_389": "Is there anyone else with copies of your apartment keys?",
 "co_390": "I live alone, I don't give my keys to anyone, not even to \nmy girlfriend.",
 "co_391": "Charles, we found this in your father's place, could \nyou explain the purpose of this money?",
 "co_392": "This was for my girlfriend, Ginger. \nI paid for her breast implant surgery.",
 "co_393": "Isn't that kinda too much for breast augmentation?",
 "co_394": "The surgery was done by the best plastic surgeon in \nthe country, that's why it was so expensive!",
 "co_395": "I'm green with envy right now.",
 "co_396": "And where could Ginger be right now?",
 "co_397": "She's here at the station waiting for me.",
 "co_398": "We might as well talk to her, right Kenny?",
 "co_399": "Why the hell would you want to talk to Ginger!?",
     "co_403": "Let's say we had differences in life values, \nbut that's about it.",
 "co_400": "She could never have done anything to father!",
 "co_401": "We'll talk to her just like we're talking to you, \nevery piece of info is useful!",
 "co_402": "We were told you and your father had a cat–dog \nrelationship, is that true?",
 "co_404": "Dad always wanted me to be more present in his business...",
 "co_405": "But I just want to enjoy life, what else'd you expect \nfrom a twenty-one-year-old?",
    "co_405a": "But I just want to enjoy life, what else'd you expect \nfrom someone my age?",
 "co_406": "You have a point.",
 "co_407": "What the hell would I gain by killing my father, \nbesides a life sentence?",
 "co_408": "                       I think I've heard someone say that before.",
 "co_409": "                       Oh right, it was me.",
 "co_410": "Okay, rub it in my face as much as you want.",
 "co_411": "That'll be enough, thanks for all the help.",
 "co_412": "We'd love to have a quick chat with Ginger, could \nyou ask her to come in? ",
 "co_413": "Sure, Mr douche, but take it easy on her, I'm not sure how \nshe's gonna react after everything.",
 "co_414": "Leave this to me and Mr. douche here!",
 "co_415": "He was more worried about his girlfriend than his father, \nbut I don't think he has anything to hide from us.",
 "co_416": "But U$100,000.00 in cash for freaking breast implants?",
 "co_417": "That also bothered me more than it should.",
 "co_418": "Something's off with that, let's dig deeper!",
 "co_419": "That's enough",
 "co_420": "Morning, Mr. Clemenza, I'm detective Kennedy and this \nis my partner, Mia-",
 "co_421": "Yeah, don't even bother asking me questions, \nI'm not talking to you guys.",
 "co_422": "But I'm glad you brought your intern, I'd love a coffee \nright now, sweetie.",
 "co_423": "Chill, let's try to talk with him first.",
 "co_424": "For me, this case is closed. \nLet's do a Seance using this jerk's name.",
 "co_425": "Choose a question:",
 "co_426": "Confront him",
 "co_427": "About Charles",
 "co_428": "About his alibi",
 "co_429": "Mister, could you explain the message you left at Bruno's \nvoicemail?",
 "co_430": "Something about killing him over a million in debt?",
 "co_4302": "We couldn't find any debt in Bruno's name, what were \nyou talking about?",
 "co_431": "He must have bought a lot of chicken to fry, right?",
 "co_432": "Ah, that?",
 "co_433": "It was just a prank, none of your business.",
 "co_434": "Well, since I'm not under arrest, can I go now?",
 "co_4344": "Sure, the door's right there.",
 "co_435": "Come on Kenny, it was just a prank, bro!",
 "co_436": "Aw man, leaving already? \nI was hoping you could teach me that stock scam of yours!",
"co_436a": "I was in need of money for my new skin care routine.",
 "co_437": "The hell, how?!",
 "co_438": "Oh, did I say something that made you upset?",
 "co_439": "How could you possibly know that?",
 "co_440": "You don't have to be an expert to figure your little scam out.",
 "co_443": "We actually searched that on wikipedia, your scam \nis called: ''Pump and dump''.",
 "co_444": "Why the heck teachers dislike Wikipedia? \nIt has lots of fact checkers and good references.",
 "co_445": "I'll never understand that, either.",
 "co_446": "But it seems like you guys've been ''Pumping and dumping'' \nfor a few years without being caught, huh?",
 "co_447": "I was just being used by Bruno, you have to believe me!",
 "co_448": "I just did the dirty work for him because... \nHe kept me under constant threats, it was horrible!",
 "co_449": "Luckily for you, denouncing you is not our goal!",
 "co_450": "I don't understand, what do you want from me?",
 "co_451": "If you really killed your brother, you'll be caught.",
 "co_452": "But you can still get away with that scam of yours, \nwe'll play blind if you help!",
 "co_453": "Now, confess that you killed Bruno and face your trial.",
 "co_454": "Or get convicted of murder anyway, plus answer for \nfraud and pay millions in fines.",
 "co_455": "If it was one of your henchmen, you can get away with \nit without answering for any charges!",
 "co_456": "All you have to do is give us a name, sounds like \na sweet deal, right, Kenny?",
 "co_457": "You bet, so what's your call, Richard?",
 "co_458": "I'd love to help, even if it had been a partner, \nbut I have no idea who killed my brother!",
 "co_459": "And I beg, don’t denounce me... \nI'm a new man now, I swear!!!",
 "co_460": "How much do you guys want to let this go?",
 "co_461": "There's this bracelet from Brittany & Co. \nthat I think is sooo cute.",
 "co_462": "Shut up, Mia.",
 "co_463": "Just help us and we will decide if you deserve it.",
 "co_464": "Let's talk about Charles, what do you think of him?",
 "co_465": "That spoiled brat never had to work a day in his life, \nhe's only good at getting into trouble!",
 "co_466": "Once he came home from a party with a freaking tiger, and locked \nit in Bruno's bathroom.",
    "co_466a": "He kept saying that its name was Mr. Louie.",
 "co_467": "This sounds like a bad comedy movie that I'd enjoy, \nfor some reason.",
 "co_468": "Did you know that Charles' gun and car were used?",
 "co_469": "Yeah, this doesn't make any sense, Charles'd never kill \nhis father...",
 "co_470": "Believe me, the killer is not someone from within this family, \nI know every Clemenza too well to say this.",
 "co_471": "Richard, where were you last night?",
 "co_472": "I was at a shooting range, I always go there to relieve stress, \nand yesterday I was really needing it.",
 "co_473": "Were you using Bruno as a target, by any chance?",
 "co_474": "Is there any way to confirm that you were there?",
 "co_475": "Let's say that there is a possibility that they evade taxes, \nso they don't register anything there.",
 "co_476": "But you can ask the owner, he will confirm that I have been there.",
 "co_477": "I should get a medal for being the only \nnon-criminal in this city.",
 "co_478": "What part of ''not talking'' you don't understand, detective?",
 "co_479": "I may consider saying something if your intern'd make that coffee.",
 "co_480": "If you call me intern one more time, I'll \nmake you drink coffe from up your-",
 "co_481": "Don't, girl.",
 "co_482": "That'll enough for now, thank you for your time.",
 "co_483": "Now, I have to get back to work.",
 "co_484": "Dude, this guy deadass tried to blame his dead brother \nfor his crimes.",
 "co_485": "Can we even believe a single word he said?",
 "co_486": "The only thing we have confirmed is that he is \nan asshole, indeed.",
 "co_487": "I was pretty sure he'd at least turn in \nthe person who did it!",
 "co_488": "I mean, we put a lot of pressure on him, right?",
 "co_489": "I feel that if Richard's the killer, we'll only confirm \nit by using his name in a Seance.",
 "co_490": "Yeah, his weak alibi leaves us with no choice.",
 "co_491": "I hate to have to say this, but I agree.",
 "co_492": "Also, we’re going to expose this jerk's scams, right?",
 "co_493": "Do you still have doubts about this?",
 "co_494": "Richard Clemenza is now a suspect.",
 "co_495": "Woaah, this is so cool, I feel inside a Law & Order episode!",
 "co_496": "She does not look unsettled at all.",
 "co_497": "Ask about the surgery",
 "co_498": "Ask about her alibi",
 "co_499": "Ask about Bruno",
 "co_500": "Ginger, could you tell us a little about your surgery?",
 "co_501": "Sure thing!",
 "co_502": "I got an 800cc silicone implant, I got REAL sick with the \nanesthesia, and I'm still all swollen and in pain.",
 "co_503": "But the rest went great, because my doc is simply THE BEST.",
 "co_504": "He has a long wait list, but I can arrange an appointment for \nyou, I think you could really use it, girl.",
 "co_505": "That's so kind of you, but I think I'll pass.",
 "co_506": "After all, I don't have a 100K in cash to \nhand over to him.",
 "co_507": "What, but how?",
 "co_508": "Ginger, tell us the truth, was that money used only \nfor your surgery?",
 "co_509": "Duh, what else would I do with that money?",
 "co_510": "That was kinda invasive from you guys, but I have all the \nreceipts and medical attestations right here.",
 "co_511": "Feel free to examine them.",
 "co_512": "Well, one hundred grand, everything seems in order here.",
 "co_513": "Ginger, where were you last night?",
 "co_514": "Sedated and sleeping like an angel for 12 hours straight, \nwhy do you ask?",
 "co_515": "We need to discard as many suspects as possible, \nsorry about that, lass.",
 "co_516": "But no one can kill while sleeping, you're good.",
 "co_517": "And do you have any idea of how bad my breasts hurt?",
 "co_518": "I can barely move my arms around, let alone shoot with that \ncannon of a gun.",
 "co_519": "What kinda relationship you had with Bruno?",
 "co_520": "I was never really close to him, but of course I liked \nhim very much, he was the father of my boo!",
 "co_521": "He never thought twice before helping us when we needed it most!",
 "co_522": "Like when he paid for our trip to Dubai when Charles and I \nwere celebrating our one-month anniversary!",
    
 "co_523": "We stayed at Atlantis, the Palm, did you know that it is the \nonly 7 star hotel in the world?",
 "co_524": "Holy cow, these people live in a parallel reality.",
 "co_525": "We also went to that famous guy's steakhouse, Savory Babe!",
 "co_526": "His steaks get an extra flavor when he sprinkles salt \nin that funny way!",
 "co_527": "That extra flavor is probably sweat from his \nforearm, you know.",
 "co_528": "Wait a minute, those are...",
 "co_529": "Lovely, but we are short on time here, we gotta go on, \nsorry, lass!",
 "co_530": "That will be enough, thanks for coming.",
    "co_530a": "Sure, if you need me, let me know! ♥",
 "co_531": "Did you buy it?",
 "co_532": "Dude, what's with all these medical attestations?",
 "co_533": "She came to accompany Charles, but at the same time the \ngirl came prepared for an interrogation?",
 "co_534": "She has a strong alibi, though.",
 "co_535": "Indeed, but hey, didn't you notice anything off?",
 "co_536": "Aside from the fact that she's the hottest girl \nI have ever met?",
 "co_537": "Dude, in the Dubai selfie she showed us, she's wearing the same \nearring that we found in Bruno's apartment!",
 "co_538": "Wait, I didn't notice it, are you sure about that? ",
 "co_539": "Yeah, but you were too busy looking at her breasts, \nweren't you?",
 "co_540": "I'd never be so unprofessional.",
 "co_541": "Speaking of the earring, it vanished from my pocket, \nwhere the hell is it?! ",
 "co_542": "Nevermind the earring.",
 "co_543": "She said she didn't have much contact with Bruno, but somehow \nher earring ended up in his apartment!",
 "co_544": "You are right, her testimony was very fishy.",
 "co_545": "Maybe we have let something slip through, but something is \nvery off with this girl.",
 "co_546": "What I found funny is that she knew about the gun, even though \nnot even Charles did until 5 minutes ago.",
 "co_547": "Eh, you are right, this girl is totally worth doing a Seance!",
 "co_548": "Also, we got what the spirit told us.",
 "co_549": "It would kinda make sense the stuff about ''Charles' fault'' if \nshe's the killer, since she's Charles' girlfriend!",
 "co_550": "I didn't hear any spirits, if we fail once again, \nI won’t take any responsibility!",
 "co_551": "Ginger is now a suspect.",
 "co_552": "Morning, I'm detective Kennedy and this is \nmy partner, Mia, we'd like to-",
 "co_553": "Glad you arrived, Doc.",
 "co_554": "My back is hurting like hell, would you doctors \nkindly prescribe me a painkiller?",
 "co_555": "We are not doctors, sir. We are here to talk about your boss.",
 "co_556": "Can we at least ask if he has more of it for us?",
 "co_557": "Don't worry, I got this.",
 "co_558": "As I was saying...",
 "co_559": "About his job",
 "co_560": "Can you tell us why Bruno fired you?",
 "co_561": "Frankly, darling, I don't give a damn.",
 "co_562": "What?",
 "co_563": "That's right, next question.",
 "co_564": "Mister, did you also have access to Charles's car?",
 "co_565": "Are you talking with me?",
 "co_566": "Hmm, yes?",
 "co_567": "What was your card doing in Charles' car?",
 "co_568": "Yes, I am, we must confirm who had access to it because-",
 "co_569": "You're not!",
 "co_570": "I'm not what?",
 "co_571": "You're not getting anywhere with this, dude.",
 "co_572": "Sebastian, I'll be very clear here: Have you killed Bruno?",
 "co_573": "Could you rephrase?",
 "co_574": "Ah, yes!",
 "co_575": "Have you assassinated Bruno?",
 "co_576": "So, you do admit that you have kil-",
 "co_577": "Yes, vaccines DO NOT cause autism, Doc!",
 "co_578": "He's more lucid than a lot of people out there.",
 "co_579": "Know what, let's leave this for later, thanks \nfor your time, Mister!",
 "co_580": "Nice, I hope to have helped you doctors!",
 "co_581": "You have really helped us a lot!",
 "co_582": "I learn so much every day from you, Kenny!",
 "co_583": "I learn what not to do in an investigation, to be more precise.",
 "co_584": "At least I tried, okay?",
 "co_585": "This guy is gonna be another one of those cases, where we’ll \nonly know if he’s our killer while we test it with a seance.",
 "co_586": "If I had to put in my 2 cents, the only crime he committed \nwas driving intoxicated.",
 "co_587": "He has no good reason to have killed Bruno!",
 "co_588": "Maybe, but I still think it's fishy that his \ncard was inside Charles' car. ",
 "co_589": "True that, but let's consider well our options before we \ndecide anything!",
 "co_590": "Sebastian is now a suspect.",
 "co_591": "About Sebastian, we tried to question him already, \nbut with no success so far...",
 "co_592": "And why is that?",
 "co_593": "The guy is, how can I put it... ",
 "co_594": "''High as a kite'', haha!",
 "co_595": "Perhaps you guys would rather do something else, \nwhile we try to talk to the guy?",
 "co_596": "Lagertha, we're running against the clock here.",
 "co_597": "I have years of experience in interrogation, \nI'm sure I'll get something from him!",
 "co_598": "Now, if you excuse us!",
 
 "co_601": "This morning I showered and had my coffee, like usual. ",
 "co_602": "But when I went to pick up the mail... \nI didn't find a million Pounds inside my mailbox.",
 "co_603": "So I came here to check if you need any help with \nsending me my money, brother.",
 "co_604": "Can't do that, I don't have it right now.",
 "co_605": "Bullshit, surely you must have more than a million \nafter our scheme.",
 "co_604a": "You're too tense, brother, would you like some Whisky?",
 "co_604b": "How about some hookers?",     
 "co_606": "I made investments with our money, but soon I'll have \nit back and I'll pay you, Richard.",
 "co_608": "Quit this nonsense and just give me my mon-",
 "co_609": "Oh, God!!!",
 "co_610": "We're in World Cup season, don't tell me you used our \nmoney to bet again...",
 "co_611": "Our return is certain because the Brazil's team is on fire! \nThere's no way they'll lose to Germany!",
 "co_612": "*Chuckles* \nPoor man.",
 "co_613": "How much...?",
 "co_614": "400 grand.",
 "co_615": "Did you bet 400,000 pounds on a football game?",
 "co_616": "No, bro, 400 grand remaining.",
 "co_617": "YOU F@#$%NG DONKEY!",
 "co_617a": "Did you bet a million Pounds of MY MONEY?! \nPlease, tell me that I'm dreaming...",
 "co_618": "You're dreaming!",
 "co_619": "Not really, though.",
 "co_620": "Is this a joke to you, you dipshit?",
 "co_621": "FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS!",
 "co_621a": "You made me convince my men to spend 500K Pounds \non trashy cheap stocks...",    
 "co_622": "Now I have to tell them I lost their money because \nthe donkey I call brother spent it all gambling?",
 "co_623": "If you're trying to get us killed, congratulations...",
 "co_624": "Because you're doing a great freaking job on it!",
 "co_625": "Am I watching extras of the Wolf of the Wallstreet?",
 "co_626": "I'd never tell that these guys sell frickin' chicken!",
 "co_627": "Stop thinking small, Richard, they'll have their money!",
 "co_628": "Instead of 400 thousand, we can have 2 million for us. \nI'm a visionary, that's how I play.",
 "co_629": "If by visionary you mean game addict, \nthen I have to agree.",
 "co_631": "Here, take dad's ring as a pledge.",
 "co_632": "Bruno took the ring off his finger and handed it to Richard.",
 "co_633": "Is this a joke? \nThis is not worth a hundredth of what you owe us.",
 "co_634": "This ring was the only good thing Dad left us, \nnow look at everything I’ve achieved!",
 "co_635": "Everything with my wit, not yours!",
 "co_636": "Now do your part and buy me time, I will settle this out.",
 "co_637": "As if I had another choice!",
 "co_638": "Hey there, are you having a stroke?",
 "co_639": "*Huff huff*",
 "co_640": "Bruno was ran over!",
 "co_641": "No shit, Sherlock!",
 "co_641x": "It's not like seven different people have already said that \nto us today.",     
 "co_642": "I mean that I saw Bruno being run over, you jerk.",
 "co_642x": "When I touch an object with emotional value to the dead, \nI can see a flashback associated to them!",    
 "co_643": "It can be from a happy memory to a sad or infuriating one.",
 "co_644x": "Good thing that I'm alive, then. You'd see some messed \nup stuff touching my notebook.",
"co_644": "And what did you see now?",    
 "co_645": "Bruno and his brother Richard were involved \nin a stock market scam!",
 "co_646": "Bruno was indebted to the scammers, one million \npounds, to be precise.",
 "co_647": "Pounds?",
 "co_648": "Mia, we're not savages, how much is that in real money?",
 "co_649": "One and a half million dollars, I guess?",
 "co_652": "Anyway, Bruno used all his money to bet on Brazil \nin its match against Germany!!",
 "co_653": "Holy shit, being shot and run over sounds like a trip \nto Disneyland compared to this.",
 
 "co_656": "Well, we already have a starting point then.",
 "co_657": "Let's see what else we can find out about this Richard.",
 "co_658": "Aye!",

 "co_662": "Sorry, boss, I had to swerve to avoid hitting \nthe poor unicorn!",
 "co_663": "Silly me! \nHow could I not have thought of that?!",
 "co_664": "Just out of sheer curiosity, you wouldn't have been \ndriving while stoned again, right, Sebastian?",
 "co_665": "Hmm, perhaps?",
 "co_665a": "Hey, Boss?",  
  "co_665b": "What, Sebastian?",

 "co_668": "Rise and shine, sleepy!",
 "co_669": "I hate that feeling, it always catches me off guard!",
 "co_670": "Bruno was enraged with his driver for crashing his car!",
 "co_671": "For some reason, Sebastian was inside Bruno's apartment.",
 "co_672": "And his card was inside Charles' car, which doesn't \nmake sense, since he was not his driver.",
 "co_673": "That puts the driver higher in the suspicion list, then.",
 "co_674": "Let's see what else we can find about the guy.",
 "co_675": "Hmm, what to ask?",
 "co_676": "Check this suspect's information?",
 "co_677": "This is the victim's son, Charles.",
 "co_678": "It seems that he's missing and his car and gun were \nused in this crime!",
 "co_679": "He's our best suspect so far, so let's try a Seance \nwith his name near the body!",
 "co_680": "Thanks to the Seance that Kenny forced me to rush, we now know that \nhe is inno.",
 "co_681": "We should use this to our advantage and extract information from Charles \nwhen he is found.",
 "co_682": "The suspects' log has been updated!",
 "co_683": "This is the victim's brother, Richard.",
 "co_684": "He is Bruno's right-hand man, they ran the family restaurants \nand practiced scams together.",
 "co_685": "He's a strong suspect, since they had a big conflict recently, \nso we should try a Seance with his name!",
 "co_686": "I thought he might have something to do with his brother's \nmurder, but he's inno.",
 "co_687": "This is the victim's personal driver, Sebastian.",
 "co_688": "We know very little about this guy.",
 "co_689": "But his card was found inside the car used in the crime, \nand he was recently in Bruno's apartment!",

 "co_703": "My daughter was having problems with some people... \nYou must go after those scoundrels!",
 "co_704": "My condolences, ma'am, but know that you have the best \ndetectives working on this case.",
 "co_705": "I'll try to be brief here:",
 "co_706": "Who are the suspects?",
 "co_707": "About Lucy",
 "co_708": "Who are the people that you've mentioned, ma'am?",
 "co_709": "There was this crazy man that would follow my daughter \neverywhere: into bars, her gym and even to work!",
 "co_710": "She ended up making a restraining order against him...",
 "co_711": "But that didn't stop him, until the day he was arrested for breaking \ninto her apartment!",
 "co_712": "Sheesh, what a weirdo.",
 "co_713": "Please, you have to go after that bastard!",
 "co_714": "Believe me that we will, do you remember his name?",
 "co_715": "Yes, his name was Joe Badger, that creep...",
 "co_716": "I brought a copy of the restraining order for you.",
 "co_717": "Marvelous, anyone else we should be looking out for?",
 "co_718": "A colleague of Lucy from this theater, Anna.",
 "co_719": "Lucy'd never tell me much about her, but I'm sure that \nsomething was off with that girl...",
 "co_720": "Ever since my daughter started talking about her, \nshe distanced herself more and more from me!",
 "co_721": "To the point of cutting total contact! \nI know she'd never have done this on her own!",
 "co_722": "When was the last time you had contact with Lucy?",
 "co_723": "She was talking about how frustrated she was that her \nDirector had chosen Anna instead of her for a role.",
 "co_724": "Ugh... That was two weeks ago, I guess.",
 "co_725": "And I found this in my daughter's things, I think it came from Anna!",
 "co_726": "Miriam handed the paper over to Mia.",
 "co_727": "Lucy used to live in Los Angeles as far as I know, \nwhat was she doing in here?",
 "co_728": "Lucy never explained to me why she left Hollywood.",
 "co_729": "I tried to convince her to return to Hollywood, \nI tried really hard, believe me...",
 "co_730": "How rude of you to doze off while a grieving mother talked.",
 "co_731": "Oh come on, those lapses are involuntary.",
 "co_732": "Now that woman must think I'm some kind of psychopath.",
 "co_733": "Actually, lucky you, because you didn't have to \nwatch her being arrested!",
 "co_734": "That was pretty awkward, I didn’t know what \nsort of face I should make!",
 "co_735": "What the heck, what did I miss?",
 "co_736": "The agents said Lucy called the cops after being attacked by her \nmother yesterday, so Miriam was detained for now.",
 "co_737": "Then she lied about the last time she spoke with Lucy!",
 "co_738": "Yeah, and what did you see in that lapse?",
 "co_739": "Well...",
 "co_740": "In this case, let's try to find out more about this Jenn \nand Lucy's mother!",
 "co_741": "Yeah, Lucy's apartment would be a good start.",
 "co_742": "And don't forget about the Director at the station!",
 "co_743": "I should stop touching random stuff people hand me, dude.",
 "co_744": "Hey Lucy, thank you for coming, take a seat!",
 "co_745": "Hey Jenn, how are you hanging in there?",
 "co_745a": "Jenn waved at the waiter, who promptly came to their table.",
 "co_745b": "What would you like, Lucy?",
 "co_745c": "Nothing, thank you, I’ll be leaving soon!",
 "co_745d": "And I'll have a large pumpkin spice latte with hmmm...",
 "co_745e": "Eight espresso shots!",
 "co_745f": "Dude, just do cocaine at this point.",
 "co_745g": "Jenn, sorry for the rush, but can you tell me what this is about?",
 "co_746": "My lunch break is short, I only came because you said it was \nan emergency...",
 "co_747": "It's about my convention last week, Jennacon, \nthe one you were supposed to attend...",
 "co_748": "I heard the news about it, I'm sorry for what happened!",
 "co_749": "If there's any way I can help-.",
 "co_750": "Then you probably heard that everyone wants my head now, \nI want you to pay for my lawyers!",
 "co_751": "Please make a deposit to this account, they'll tell me \ntheir exact fee tomorrow morning.",
 "co_752": "Jenn handed the paper with the bank account information to Lucy.",
 "co_753": "I was just being polite about the help thing!",
 "co_754": "I have nothing to do with this, why do I have to pay your lawyers?",
 "co_755": "Maybe if you had gone as you promised, your fans wouldn't \nhave been so furious with me!",
 "co_756": "You made people stand under a 95 °F sun, your attendees \nburned alive waiting in lines!",
 "co_757": "So maybe, just maybe, that's why they got pissed at you?",
 "co_758": "Nonsense, the convention was a total success!",
 "co_7588": "We had only minor logistical problems.",
  "co_760": "Jenn, five people literally died at your conference, \nhow could that have been a ''total success''?",
 "co_757a": "And I announced on twitter that I'd not attend the second \nday for the safety of my fans, by the way.",     
 "co_762": "It doesn't change the fact you DIDN'T SHOW UP!",
 "co_763": "Are you even listening to me? \nArgh-",
 "co_764": "My only regret was considering attending your \nwannabe convention!",
 "co_765": "Your second regret will be making me your enemy, \nI can promise you that, girl.",
 "co_766": "Yeah, okay, good luck with that mess you got \nyourself into. Now if you’ll excuse me.",
 "co_767": "Lucy, please wait!!!",
 "co_768": "What now?",
 "co_769": "I need money to pay for this coffee.",
 "co_769a": "You're kidding me, right?",

 "co_882": "Nobody but Miriam seems to know about Anna, which is strange.",

 "co_895": "Despite the breach of contract, we now know that Don did not kill \nCondor.",
 "co_896": "So let's forget him for now.",
 "co_897": "This is Jean Aiello, a hitman hired by Condor.",
 "co_898": "His task was to assassinate Don Cappelletti, but he \nfailed to do so.",
 "co_899": "Or maybe he didn't do it on purpose.",
 "co_900": "He may have stolen the money and killed Condor himself!",
 "co_901": "That's what I think, too, the guy's a strong suspect.",
 "co_902": "Now we know that he is innocent, we better forget about him.",

 "co_926": "If you have nothing to do with it, this is your best opportunity \nto prove it to us.",

 "co_945": "You sick man.",
 "co_946": "So, tell me about your cottage, are you the original owner?",
 "co_947": "No, I bought it.",
 "co_948": "Actually, I was paid to take it.",
 "co_949": "What do you mean?",
 "co_950": "There was this blonde woman who appeared out of \nnowhere a few years ago.",
 "co_951": "She offered me five thousand dollars to register the \ncottage in my name, and that was it.",
 "co_952": "But simple as that, don't you think that was a bit fishy?",
 "co_953": "She was such a nice lass that I'd never've imagined that the \ngoddamn cottage'd be used for murders.",
 "co_954": "But I guess I should've seen that coming.",
 "co_955": "Do you remember her name?",
 "co_956": "She introduced herself as Margot, but now I'm not \neven sure if that was her real name.",
 "co_957": "I wrote down her license plate, though, I thought \nit might come in handy someday.",

 "co_963": "The bunker's hidden inside the fireplace, if they are hiding \nsomething, then it's probably there.",
 "co_964": "I appreciate your help, see you soon, Mr. Norton.",
 "co_965": "Woah, he stabbed the woman in the back with so \nlittle effort from us!",
 "co_966": "Better to check on this Margot first, it doesn't \nmean that Rupert is innocent yet.",
 "co_967": "After all, you said that the killer is a man this time.",
 "co_968": "Yeah, and let's check out that bunker, I have \na feeling that it'll help a lot.",
 "co_969": "Rupert Norton is now a suspect.",
 "co_970": "I can't even enjoy the feeling of holding 10K \nthat I'm sent to the astral world.",
 "co_971": "Life's not fair, dude.",
 "co_972": "Look if it's not the almighty Gregory Condor! \nCome on in, be very welcome to my humble office!",
 "co_973": "You may be humble, but I can't say the same \nabout your office, sir!",
 "co_974": "Have a seat, would you accept a glass \nof William Larue Weller?",
 "co_975": "If God gave birth to a bourbon child, this is what it would \ntaste like, I shit you not.",
 "co_976": "Thank you, but I don't drink. \nHonestly, I prefer orange juice.",
 "co_977": "If it weren't an MMA fighter telling me that, I'd have gone \nphysical on you right now.",
 "co_978": "Your henchman told me that you had a proposal \nfor me, Don Cappeletti.",
 "co_979": "You're the kind of man who likes to get straight to the \npoint, right?",
 "co_980": "That's fine by me.",
 "co_981": "First of all, kudos for your 8-fight win streak, being 8-0 in \nthe UFC is not for anyone.",
 "co_982": "You may have heard, but your next fight has already broken \nthe underworld betting records.",
 "co_983": "On top of that, you're up against Nathan Weekz, the guy's \ngood, but he doesn't compare to you, my boy!",
 "co_985": "Yeah, so what?",
 "co_986": "If you fight the way I say, I can make a lot of money, and \nput a lot into it!",
 "co_987": "You only need to win the first two rounds, and then \nlet Nathan win the last three. \nFor you... This will be a piece of cake!",
 "co_988": "Losing to make you rich, huh, is that some kind of joke?",
 "co_989": "I know that you have an ego issue, but I also know that \nevery man has his price.",
 "co_990": "Don Cappelletti put the password into a leather briefcase.",

 "co_994": "Listen Gregory, it's not a shame to lose a single fight, \nespecially if you win the first rounds.",
 "co_995": "You have already made history, there is no man who can \nscoff at the streak you've left behind!",
 "co_996": "You're right, I know that there is a time and place to \nswallow my pride.",
 "co_997": "Where do I sign?",
 "co_998": "Attaboy', I knew you were a man of good sense!",
 "co_999": "But I have to make something clear here: If you accept making \na deal with me, you'll become my employee.",
 "co_1000": "And when my employees step out of line... \nThey have to deal with my HR manager, Mr. Louie.",

 "co_1002": "Holy shit, why is there a tiger here?",
 "co_1003": "I wanna pet Mr. Louie so bad!",
 "co_1004": "This is Mr. Louie, and if you break our little deal here... \nYou'll have to explain yourself to him!",
 "co_1005": "My last naughty employee did not have a good time with Mr. Louie... \nBut at least I didn't have to buy him food for a month!",

 "co_1014": "You guys dug out everything?",
 "co_1015": "We found two briefcases full of hundred dollar bills in there.",
 "co_1016": "Hmmm- \nSomething's off, there should be three suitcases in total!",
 "co_1017": "What did you see, exactly?",
 "co_1018": "This Don Cappelletti is a notorious mobster, it blows my mind \nthat Condor was involved with him.",
 "co_1019": "Let's check out that cottage now, shall we?",
 "co_1019a": "If we find one more penny and you hand it over to those agents... \nI'll roundhouse kick you!",      
 "co_1020": "I'm not gonna ask why an MMA fighter'd wanna kill a mobster...",
 "co_1021": "But Don always sticks with his thugs... \nThis job'll be ridiculously difficult if I have to hurry like this.",
 "co_1022": "So my price will be a million dollars, considering all \nthe inconveniences I might have to deal with. \nCash. Non-negotiable, sorry.",
 "co_1023": "I'll give you some time to think about whether this is \nreally what you want and also to get the money-",
 "co_1024": "They told me that this'd be the amount you'd ask for, \ntake it and finish that bastard off.",
 "co_1025": "But you must do it before my fight tomorrow, understood?",
 "co_1026": "Well, shit! \nIf that's the case, I'm gonna call my men tonight \nand get everything ready!",
 "co_1027": "Just tell me one more thing... \nWill someone come after me when I finish this job?",
 "co_1028": "Only Don and I know what this is about, so you \nwon't have any problems later!",
 "co_1029": "I'd not be so sure about that, my dude.",
 "co_1030": "Well, well, then consider it done. \nDon Cappelletti will be no more by tomorrow night.",
 "co_1031": "Also, have this.",
 "co_1032": "The hitman tossed the gold coin to Gregory.",
 "co_1033": "The hell is this?",
 "co_1034": "It's a contract guarantee, a tradition between hitmen, \nreturn it to me when the work is finished.",
 "co_1035": "Boy, that's a dumb way to leave evidence behind.",
 "co_1036": "In short, the guy preferred to use Don's own money to \nhire a hitman to kill him... ",
 "co_1037": "Instead of just losing the damn fight?",
 "co_1038": "Yup!",
 "co_1039": "And I thought that I had ego issues.",

 "co_1041": "Excuse me, sir, I have a report.",
 "co_1042": "Go ahead, please.",
 "co_1043": "We went to Don Cappelletti's office a few hours ago.",
 "co_1044": "After not getting an answer, we broke into it, only to find that \nhe was not there.",
 "co_1045": "Then agent Smith proceeded to be mauled by a Bengal Tiger...",
 "co_1046": "I forgot to mention about Mr. Louie!",
 "co_1047": "What was that, lass?",
 "co_1048": "Oh, nothing, my condolences for Agent Smith.",
 "co_1049": "He's not dead, but he’ll be on sick leave for a \nfew weeks now, though.",
 "co_1050": "Anyway, we managed to sedate the beast and take it to the \ntown's zoo.",
 "co_1051": "Then we received a tip that Don Cappelletti was seen in \na famous brothel, where we found him!",
 "co_1052": "At the moment, he is being detained at the DBI, \nfeel free to interview him!",
 "co_1053": "Thanks for letting us know, we'll be there soon!",
 "co_1054": "You knew about the tiger, didn't you?",
 "co_1055": "I have to deal with a lot of details during Seances, \nsometimes I let little things slip through!",
 "co_1056": "Tell me how a Bengal Tiger chilling in an office \ncan be considered a ''little thing''?",
 "co_1057": "You talk as if you have never made mistakes before!",
 "co_1058": "If I ever go to a place that might have a 500 pound \nmurderous cat in it....",
 "co_1059": "Please, don't forget to mention it.",

 "co_1062": "I'm here today to inquire about the death of Gregory Condor, \nshall we start?",
 "co_1063": "Of course, but may I ask you a favor first, gentleman?",
 "co_1064": "Name it.",
 "co_1065": "Go find yourself a DI@# to choke on, how about it?!",
 "co_1066": "I had nothing to do with that guy, you arrested an innocent \nman today and I'll make y'all pay!",
 "co_1067": "This is what I call a good start!",
 "co_1068": "Ahem, now that you've got it all out, what I'd like to know is:",
 "co_1069": "About Gregory",
 "co_1070": "Kennedy tossed the contract coin on the table.",
 "co_1071": "Do you know what this is, Mister?",
 "co_1072": "I believe it's this new stuff they call ''a coin'', \nyou dumb idiot!",
 "co_1073": "Almost right, but this is the receipt of your death contract, Don.",
 "co_1074": "Huh?",
 "co_1075": "Gregory paid one million dollars to order your murder.",
 "co_1076": "He didn't even take it out of your briefcase, he simply passed \nit on, but for some reason, you're still breathing.",
 "co_1077": "Who's the dumb idiot now?",
 "co_1078": "That son of a bi#@% did what?!",
 "co_1079": "Everything is starting to make sense now...",
 "co_1080": "Help us with info about Condor, and we can prevent you \nfrom being murdered by some John Wick. ",
 "co_1081": "So stop being a massive prick and help us here.",
 "co_1082": "*Sighs* \nFine, what do you want?",
 "co_1083": "Don Cappelletti, where were you last night?",
 "co_1084": "Ask your mother, my boy!",
 "co_1085": "Someone call the paramedics, because Kenny was obliterated!",
 "co_1086": "Tell us a little about your relationship with Condor.",
 "co_1087": "Don't know this guy.",
 "co_1088": "It's that guy to whom you handed five million \ndollars, silly!",
 "co_1089": "Don't know what you're talking about.",
 "co_1090": "So let's try this again.",
 "co_1091": "Don Cappelletti, where were you last night?",
 "co_1092": "I was at The Wallen, I spent the entire night there to celebrate... \nBecause I thought I'd earn millions...",
 "co_1093": "But I was the one who got screwed in the end! \nHaha! ",
 "co_1094": "You were where?",
 "co_1095": "It's a famous red-light district here, one of \nthe few legal in the country.",
 "co_1096": "A red-light what?",
 "co_1097": "That's a place where the brothels are, girl.",
 "co_1098": "And what would a brothel be?",
 "co_1099": "You do realize that this probably was the reason why \nyou weren't killed, right?",
 "co_1100": "The hitman probably couldn't track you there.",
 "co_1101": "I guess so.",
 "co_1102": "I need you to be honest with me, did you hear about \nthe fight yesterday?",
 "co_1103": "No, I was too busy snorting from a hooker's-",
 "co_1104": "I got the picture, so when was the first time you heard \nabout the fight?",
 "co_1105": "This morning, moments later, ten agents broke into my \nroom shouting about Gregory.",
 "co_1106": "At that moment, I knew I fucked up...",
 "co_1107": "I'm sure you can confirm my alibi with The Wallen's \nsurveillance cameras.",
 "co_1109": "Tell us a little about your relationship with Condor.",
 "co_1110": "I've been watching his fights since his spectacular UFC debut, \nthe guy was a monster inside the ring.",
 "co_1112": "But the first time I talked to him was when I proposed \nthe deal to him.",
 "co_1113": "I thought we were cool, it never passed through my head \nthat he'd do this, for fuck's sake.",
 "co_1114": "Kind of an off topic question here:",
 "co_1115": "How much did you lose in this mess?",
 "co_1116": "*Sighs* \nFive million I gave to him plus two million in the bets.",
 "co_1117": "Holy cow.",
 "co_1118": "Yeah, right? \nI might as well just drink bleach when I get home.",
 "co_1119": "Don't be like that, I'm sure life will give you plenty \nmore opportunities to get rich illicitly!",
 "co_1120": "*Chuckles* \nShut up, Mia.",
 "co_1121": "That'll be enough for now, thanks for your \ntime, Don Cappelleti.",
 "co_1122": "Thanks for the information about the hitman, I hope \nto see both of you in other circumstances soon.",
 "co_1123": "Oh, so that's what a brothel means.",
 "co_1124": "Who’s have thought that being a womanizer \nwould save someone's life.",
 "co_1125": "If only we can confirm his alibi, then we can dismiss \nthe bastard as a suspect.",
 "co_1126": "Good morning, Detective Kennedy! ",
 "co_1127": "Your presence is being requested in the \nDBI as soon as possible.",
 "co_1128": "Sure, we were heading to the station anyway.",
 "co_1129": "What have you done now?",
 "co_1130": "Lagertha probably wants to flirt, are my teeth clean?",
 "co_1130a": "There's this nasty stuff all over them, your face.",    
 "co_1131": "Morning, my name's interview and I'm here today to Mia you.",

 "co_1133": "Did you just have a stroke?",
 "co_1134": "Worry not, the legendary detective Ellen's got your back!",
 "co_1135": "Ellen, thank gosh you're here, you'll actually help me a lot!",
 "co_1136": "Why am I sitting at a table with a girl talking to herself?",
 "co_1137": "Is this a tea party or something like that?",
 "co_1138": "Ahem- \nNo sir, I'm here today to interview you about the death of \nGregory Condor.",
 "co_1139": "Is this some kind of joke?",
 "co_1140": "You mean to tell me that they hired a kid to interview me?",
 "co_1141": "That's pretty much it.",
 "co_1142": "This is the first time I'm thankful they are wasting my taxes like this.",
 "co_1143": "Alright, so... \nWhat should I ask?",
 "co_1144": "Confront him",
 "co_1145": "What do you do for a living, sir?",
 "co_1146": "I know how the system works, I'm not talking without my \nlawyer present, so just give up, kid.",

 "co_1148": "In spirit culture, this is considered a dick move.",
 "co_1149": "Too bad, huh? \nNow put me back in my goddamn cell.",
 "co_1150": "And go play Minecraft or Tiktok like kids your age do, \nleave investigations to adults.",
 "co_1151": "Mia, we can't let this perpetrator get away like that!",
 "co_1152": "Let's break his legs!",
 "co_1153": "Mia tossed the contract coin on the table.",
 "co_1154": "Before you leave, take this, I think Condor forgot \nto return it to you!",

 "co_1161": "I'm the only one who knows it, and now you're gonna \ntell me everything about Gregory.",

 "co_1168": "I. Want. My. Lawyer.",
 "co_1169": "Woah, this dude is tough!!!",
 "co_1170": "Mia, go get the torture kit, I'll tell you what to do!",
 "co_1171": "Let's try a little more before that!",
 "co_1172": "Sir, could you please state your relationship with Gregory?",
 "co_1173": "Tell him that there's no lawyer who can save him from us.",
 "co_1174": "Okay, that you were not able to kill Don is a fact.",
 "co_1175": "But what exactly were you doing last night?",
 "co_1176": "We spent the whole night trying to track down our \ntarget, with no luck.",
 "co_1177": "When the fight was over, I called Condor from a public \nphone and informed him about Don's situation.",
 "co_1178": "I told him that he should hide as soon as possible, at least \nuntil I've finished the job.",

 "co_1184": "A civilian comes out of nowhere to hire you for a \nhigh-level job, risky even for you.",
 "co_1185": "Conveniently, only he and Don know what this is all about.",
 "co_1186": "So you decide to kill Condor and take his money, \nwhich now only you know exists.",
 "co_1187": "After all, what could the repercussions be? \nMaybe Don would even reward you!",
 "co_1188": "Yes, that could have happened if I were some random low-life.",
 "co_1189": "But I'm from a niche that takes our job very seriously, \nour reputation sets us apart from the competition.",
 "co_1190": "Oooh, he's an elite low-life!",
 "co_1191": "The fact is: Our target was not at the location pointed \nout by Condor yesterday.",
 "co_1192": "The next morning, Condor is found dead, that is, after \nall this mess with Don.",
 "co_1193": "It's not that hard to connect the dots and realize who \nkilled Gregory, girl.",
 "co_1194": "Well, he has a point.",
 "co_1195": "Well, I guess that's all we had to ask, right sis'?",
 "co_1196": "Yeah, we're cool now.",
 "co_1197": "Just who the hell are you talking to- \nOh, forget it.",
 "co_1198": "You're the creepiest little girl I've ever seen.",
 "co_1199": "Please, put the briefcase back in the attic of my apartment.",
 "co_1200": "It's fine if you take a little for your skin care.",
 "co_11780": "But I really need that money to pay my guys and my lawyers, \nI beg that you have mercy.",

 "co_11800": "Wait, what?",
 "co_11810": "Now he did it.",
 "co_11820": "Well, have a nice day, see ya!",
 "co_11830": "We backed a criminal up against the wall, extracted all \nthe info we wanted, and made a million dollars!",
 "co_11840": "Pretty sweet outcome for our first interrogation, huh?",
 "co_11850": "You have ruined the guy's entire career, good job!",
 "co_11860": "But seriously now, you nail this whole interrogation \nthing, it's like you were born for this!",

 "co_11940": "Nonsense, I don't work with amateurs here.",
 "co_11950": "Besides, I'm second in command after Kenny left, so that chair \nbelongs to me.",

 "co_11970": "Excuse me, miss, but who are you talking to?",
 "co_11980": "Kim, I think I dropped my earring at the crime scene, \ncould you go get it for me?",
 "co_11990": "But miss, that's on the other side of town...",
 "co_12000": "I'll be done here when you get back, go take a break, \nyou deserve it!",

 "co_1205": "I'll show no mercy to the poor fella we're interrogating!",
 "co_1206": "So, let me get this straight... This is not a tea party...",
 "co_1207": "In fact, this office hired a kid to work as a detective?",
 "co_1208": "I'm actually 16-years-old, so not a kid at all, mind you.",
 "co_1209": "And this is my third official case at the Bureau, \nso let's get started, Mr. Jackson.",

 "co_1212": "Mia, please, you have to get an autograph for me!",
 "co_1213": "You gave up pretty fast on that whole ''no mercy'' thing, huh?",
 "co_1214": "Mr. Nickel, can you tell me about your ex-girlfriend, Margot?",
 "co_1215": "Yo girl, I've talked enough with the other detectives, we're \ndone here.",
 "co_1216": "I have a dinner with sponsors at 8, plus a show at 11. \nSo I'm out of here, sorry.",
 "co_1217": "Please take me with you!",
 "co_1218": "You'll be released for your appointments right away, \nbut first I need a favor.",
 "co_1219": "Name it.",
 "co_1220": "I need you to make a 180 degree turn.",
 "co_1221": "Hey, the guy's basically God, show more respect, please.",
 "co_1222": "Could you explain to me the purpose of this bandage, sir?",
 "co_1223": "No big deal, I got into a fight during my show yesterday, \nyou should see the guy who did this.",
 "co_1224": "Was he an MMA fighter by any chance?",
 "co_1225": "What?",
 "co_1226": "I don't know where you want to get \nwith this, but whatever.",

"co_1236": "Mister, where were you last night?", 
"co_1237": "Shhh, I know exactly what you need.", 
"co_1238": "What the heck is this?",

"co_1241": "I know kids your age go crazy with my music, I even signed it \nfor you, you're welcome.", 
"co_1242": "Well, thanks but I really don't-", 
"co_1243": "By gosh, Mia, just take it already, his new album is indeed lit.", 
"co_1244": "And thank him for me, his signed CD is a relic.", 
"co_1245": "Uh, thank you mister, I guess.", 
"co_1246": "Mr. Ten Nickel, have you ever heard about Gregory Condor?", 
"co_1247": "That doesn't matter, but he heard about Ten Nickel for sure, yo.", 
"co_1248": "He's so cool, stop trying to make him look bad!", 
"co_1249": "Whose side are you here, you brat?", 
"co_1250": "Mister Ten Nickel, where were you last night?", 
"co_1251": "I was giving an epic show at Tropicana Hotel and Casino.", 
"co_1252": "My presence has been recorded on my fans' social media, and \nthe promoters of the event also confirm that I was there.", 
"co_1253": "That's why the other detectives have already dropped me \nas a suspect, girl.", 
"co_1254": "So why do you even bother?", 
"co_1255": "Do you want to tell me that you were stabbed in the afternoon and \nat night you were giving a show as if nothing had happened?", 
"co_1256": "Ketamine does wonders, girl.", 
"co_1257": "Dude, this person was wearing a helmet, how could \nthat be called an alibi?", 
"co_1258": "This is my artistic costume, I always wear the helmet in my shows.", 
"co_1259": "He's right, it's kind of his registered mark.", 
"co_1260": "And I'm a vocalist, my fans'd easily recognize it if \nit weren't me that night.", 
"co_1261": "Tell me, have you ever heard about Gregory Condor?", 
"co_1262": "Who haven't, girl?", 
"co_1263": "The guy's the biggest Heavyweight ass-whooper to ever \nstep foot in the UFC.", 
"co_1264": "I am flattered that you think I would stand a \nchance against my MMA idol.", 
"co_1265": "I'm sorry for the reality check, but I'd have \nthe same fate as Weekz.", 
"co_1266": "So you were a fan of the guy, huh?", 
"co_1267": "Yeah, my username in League of Myths was inspired \non him: Condor_Pimp69420.", 
"co_1268": "Then you do play League of Myths!", 
"co_1269": "Yeah, so what?", 
"co_1270": "Well, it was nice talking to you, girl, but I have to go.", 
"co_1271": "Please Mia, say it now, I beg!", 
"co_1272": "Sir, could you make a dedication to my friend Ellen \nat your show today?", 
"co_1273": "I got you, kiddo, don't worry.", 
"co_1274": "Feels good, man.", 
"co_1275": "Well, where do I even begin?", 
"co_1276": "His alibi sounds like bullshit, he plays the same game I \nfound on the bunker's computer and his ego...", 
"co_1277": "It's absolutely nasty!", 
"co_1278": "Yet absolutely cool.", 
"co_1279": "But how are we going to contest such alibi?", 
"co_1280": "I mean, there are several witnesses that can confirm \nthat he was at the show yesterday!", 
"co_1281": "Well, about that...", 
"co_1282": "His tattoo", 
"co_1283": "His wound", 
"co_1284": "Let's Seance", 
"co_1285": "Ellen, his tattoo in the photo was on his left shoulder, \nbut Kale's tattoo is on his right shoulder!", 
"co_1286": "Woah, you're right!", 
"co_1287": "But how did this scammer manage to sing like him?", 
"co_1288": "Hmm, maybe lip-sync?", 
"co_1289": "It's too convenient that he got into a fight on his show, \nit gave a reason for his wound...", 
"co_1290": "I have a bad feeling about this guy.", 
"co_1291": "Who cares, I can just glance at Condor's memories and \nexpose Kale's lame alibi!", 
"co_1292": "You have a point there.", 
"co_1293": "What I do not understand: What's his motivation?", 
"co_1294": "Don Cappelletti and Mr. Hitman had reasons to kill \nGregory, but Ten Nickel didn't!", 
"co_1295": "Your inquiries are more clever than Kenny's, I swear.", 
"co_1296": "Well, I don't have all these answers, but we \nrarely do before Seances.", 
"co_1297": "Let's go to the woods to find Kim and try Seances, Okay?", 
"co_1298": "Shouldn't we wait for Kim? ", 
"co_1299": "He must be heading back with your earring by now.", 
"co_1300": "I just said that to get rid of him, I don't wear earrings, \nEllen, there's no way he could have found one!", 
"co_1301": "Kale Jackson is now a suspect.", 
"co_1302": "What the hell is he doing, praying?", 
"co_1303": "We're done here, let's get blood samples from the cottage \nand arrest that psychopath!", 
"co_1304": "Wanna try another puzzle, Kenny?", 
"co_1305": "I think I'll pass, thanks.", 
"co_1306": "Forget it, Mia, at his age he'll only like to \nplay Bingo or scrabble.", 
"co_1307": "Huh, someone's calling me.", 
"co_1308": "Oh hello, Lieut., yes, I'm fine!", 
"co_1309": "Sure thing, I'll go there after lunch, no problem.", 
"co_1310": "Yeah, thanks, you too!", 
"co_1311": "That was unusual, but the lieutenant said she needs help on a case!", 
"co_1312": "Dude, this may be good, I think she wants to make up for that day.", 
"co_1313": "NO CHANCE!", 
"co_1314": "Huh?", 
"co_1315": "I mean, no chance we're working with her.", 
"co_1316": "I already told you, that woman is not to be trusted.", 
"co_1317": "What's with you, dude, I never saw you refuse a case before.", 
"co_1318": "You better have a good reason to say that, because \nthe Lieutenant literally saved my life!", 
"co_1319": "I need you to trust me for now, how about we go to \nthe Outlet after we finished up here?", 
"co_1320": "Nah, I'm fed up with this ''trust me'' story.", 
"co_1321": "Caroline needs my help and this is the least I can do for \nher after she saved my ass, end of story.", 
"co_1322": "And I want you to come with me, you two may have big egos \nbut I want you to make peace!", 
"co_1323": "...", 
"co_1324": "No objections? \nGood, then let's eat because I'm starving.", 
"co_1325": "Alright, we're here, catch you later, Ellen!", 
"co_1326": "Okay, see you later!", 
"co_1327": "Hey, Kenny... \nYou didn't even touch your food today, dude.", 
"co_1328": "I'm sorry if I was mean to you at the restaurant.", 
 "co_1328a": "I'm only doing this because I owe her, you know...",     
"co_1329": "If you really hate Caroline that much, you can take an Uber home, \nI'll manage the case with her.", 
"co_1330": "Hey, I'm your partner.", 
"co_1331": "If this is what you want, we're in this together.", 
"co_1332": "That's the Kenny I know, then let's go!", 
"co_1333": "Yeah, let's do this!", 
"co_1334": "The fight was legendary, I'm telling you.", 
"co_1335": "He dodged a couple of punches, then I hit him in the \nstomach after parrying an axe blow.", 
"co_1336": "But I underestimated my foe, and I was defeated while \nprotecting a little girl...", 
"co_1337": "Yeah, I'm pretty sure half of that didn't happen, Kim.", 
"co_1338": "Hey, Kim and Julie, have you seen the lieutenant?", 
"co_1339": "Ugh, miss!?", 
"co_1340": "Mia, why are you here, dear?", 
"co_1341": "I have come to help Caroline with a case, \nshe just called me up!", 
"co_1342": "And shouldn't Lagertha be here, too?", 
"co_1343": "We haven't heard from Chief Lagertha for two days now.", 
"co_1344": "It's the first time she's missed work since \nI was transferred here.", 
"co_1345": "But Mia, I'm happy to see you ready to work \ndespite everything that happened!", 
"co_1346": "Huh, what do you mean by th-", 
"co_1347": "Look who's here, thank you so much for coming, Mia!", 
"co_1348": "Oh, hello, Lieut.!", 
"co_1349": "I didn't get a chance to thank you that day, \nso I brought you sushi!", 
"co_1350": "I hope you like it!", 
    
"co_1351": "Aww, so cute, you didn't have to!", 
"co_1352": "Caroline carefully took the paper bag from Mia's hands \nwith a quirky smile on her face.", 
"co_1353": "They told me that Lagertha hasn't come to work since \nyesterday, do you know what happened?", 
"co_1354": "An agent tried to contact her today, but still \nhasn't gotten an answer.", 
"co_1355": "But I'm sure she's fine, she is very tough!", 
"co_1356": "I hope so... \nAnd what's the case that you need help with?", 
"co_1357": "I was assigned one last case before returning to the capital.", 
"co_1358": "It's about a guy who ''killed himself'' in a maximum \nsecurity prison after a plea bargain.", 
"co_1359": "Mia, are you sure that you're ready to take a case after all this?", 
"co_1360": "Do you mean after Condor? \nIt's okay, I feel pretty safe when I'm with you and Kenny!", 
"co_1361": "Actually, I was referring to Kennedy.", 
"co_1362": "Uh, referring to Kenny? \nWhat do you mean by that?", 
"co_1363": "Well, Detective Kennedy Leaves has been missing since \nthe day of the Condor case...", 
"co_1364": "You DO know that, right, Mia?", 
"co_1365": "You're his partner, after all.", 
"co_1366": "What, are you nuts?", 
"co_1367": "                        He's back here.", 
"co_1368": "                        Huh, but when did he leave?", 
"co_1369": "Maybe some agents will want to ask you a few questions \nabout Kennedy later.", 
"co_1370": "But don't worry, just like Lagertha, I'm sure he's fine out there!", 
"co_1371": "He has been in this profession for a long time, \nhe knows how to take care of himself!", 
"co_1372": "                       No, Lieutenant, you're wrong, \n                       he got here with m-.", 
"co_1373": "What was that, dear?", 
"co_1374": "                       Lieutenant, I need to get some fresh air...", 
"co_1375": "But of course, no rush, I will be waiting for you!", 
"co_1376": "Kenny?", 
"co_1377": "What is it with this city, there isn't a day this \ntime of year that it doesn't rain!", 
"co_1378": "Kenny, come inside, tell them that you're fine!", 
"co_1379": "I think you're right, it might be better to buy an \numbrella for our next case, Mia.", 
"co_1380": "Hey dude, I'm talking to you, come inside \nand tell them that you're-.", 
"co_1381": "I don't think I can do this for you, partner.", 
"co_1382": "What do you mean?", 
"co_1383": "Caroline is right, I never came back since Condor's.", 
"co_1384": "Stop messing around, this isn't funny.", 
"co_1385": "I messed up, Mia.", 
"co_1386": "I'm so very sorry for this.",
"co_1387": "Shut up, just shut your mouth and come inside!", 
"co_1388": "Mia suddenly comes closer to pull Kennedy by his tie.", 
"co_1389": "Just come and tell th-", 
"co_1390": "I am sorry that you have to find this out this way.", 
"co_1390a": "I tried to stop you from coming here today... \nBecause I knew this would happen.",   
     "co_1390b": "I didn't want to become yet another burden for you, Mia...",   
"co_1391": "But wh- why, but how?", 
"co_1396": "I'll show you, so you can see with your own eyes.", 
"co_1397": "What are you implying, exactly?",  
"co_1411a": "That's not what I asked, what thorough proof do you have?",    
"co_1399": "I have something funny to share with you, Lieutenant.", 
"co_1400": "All the victims in your case, without exception, had \nsomething to do with the chemical industry.", 
"co_1401": "That made me wonder: What could a farmer possibly \nhave to gain from this?", 
"co_1402": "Maybe his high school chemistry teacher failed him, \nand now he goes on a rampage on chemists?", 
"co_1403": "Kennedy, he's a serial killer, he doesn't need \na reason to do what he does.", 
"co_1404": "His defense attorney will probably just plead insanity anyway.", 
"co_1405": "I thought so, but then I realised...", 
"co_1406": "Maybe this guy doesn't hate his chemistry teacher, \nmaybe he's just covering for someone!", 
"co_1407": "Maybe someone is actually profiting from this!", 
"co_1408": "I found out that the stocks of a particular company \nskyrocketed since the beginning of this.", 
"co_1409": "Banks & Co., a company of a certain sponsor of this bureau.", 
"co_1410": "Maybe the guy you're after was by our side all along.", 
"co_1411": "That's some serious accusation, what rock-solid proof do \nyou have against Michael?", 
"co_1412": "None so far, but if you reopen the case, I'm sure \nwe'll get to the bottom of-.", 
"co_1413": "Not happening, sorry.", 
"co_1414": "What, why?", 
"co_1415": "That would mean the end of my career, the General \nsummoned me to solve this case.", 
"co_1416": "I can't just open an investigation against Michael without \nany evidence, that's not how any of this works!", 
"co_1419": "Lieutenant, you are not thinking straight, please...", 
"co_1420": "We have what I just told you, if we talk \nto Lagertha, maybe-", 
"co_1421": "What part of ''not happening'' you do not understand?", 
"co_1422": "If you keep questioning your superior, I will report this as \ncontempt, understood?", 
"co_1423": "I was not quest- \nWhatever, I can do this without you.", 
"co_1424": "Good job solving this case, you really put that \nfarmer in his place!", 
"co_1425": "Michael has seen his net worth almost double with these \ndeaths, from suppliers to partners of other labs.", 
"co_1426": "Kennedy opened the office door with disdain.", 
"co_1427": "Hey lad, you're on the case of the branded \nbodies, aren't you?", 
"co_1427a": "May I have a quick chat with the suspect?",     
"co_1428": "Mr. Leaves, I don't know if I'm allowed to do that...", 
"co_1429": "I have been thinking about choosing a new partner for \nmy next case, would you be interested?", 
"co_1430": "It would be my dream- \nKnow what.", 
"co_1431": "I need to stretch my legs, I'm going to get some coffee.", 
"co_1432": "I think I'll forget the door open, don't let my \nsuspect get away, Detective Kennedy!", 
"co_1433": "That's a good lad. \nDon't worry, I'll keep an eye on him!", 
"co_1434": "I have neither the time nor the crayons \nto explain this to you.", 
"co_1435": "But Kale left evidence behind, it's a matter of time \nbefore I catch the rest of your friends.", 
"co_1436": "You'll be in deep shit when I prove that you are \nobstructing this investigation.", 
"co_1437": "So I'm going to give you one last chance \nto redeem yourself.", 
"co_1438": "Tell me about your scheme and good things \nmay happen to you.", 
"co_1439": "May you find solace in Freya, my brother.", 
"co_1440": "Will you continue to play crazy?", 
"co_1441": "Soon this won't work out anymore, trust me.", 
"co_1442": "Kale Jackson used to have the dossier of your victims.", 
"co_1443": "But there was a particular address which I was unable \nto relate to any of the victims.", 
"co_1444": "A vacant lot behind the Banks & Co. building, funny.", 
"co_1445": "Now tell me, what will I find if I go there?", 
"co_1446": "Last chance, asshole.", 
"co_1447": "Their murders always happen on Fridays, but on those sheets \nI found a date that correspond to today, Thursday!", 
"co_1448": "If I show up there, will I come across a meeting \nof you, freaks?", 
"co_1449": "May you find solace in Frey-", 
"co_1450": "Yeah, thought so.", 
"co_1451": "Let's see how far this attitude will take you.", 
"co_1452": "After that, my memories are blurred, for some reason.", 
"co_1453": "But it was during that meeting that I was caught, \nthe one who killed me was Michael himself.", 
"co_1454": "I'm sorry for hiding it for so long, I didn't know \nhow to tell you all this.", 
"co_1455": "Mia, you need to get out of town, this place is no longer safe. \nI think they also got Lagertha...", 
"co_1456": "NO FREAKING WAY!", 
"co_1457": "Huh?", 
"co_1458": "I'll not leave, I'll not run from that crook.", 
"co_1459": "You came back as a wanderer because you'll not rest until \nthat asshole is arrested.", 
"co_1460": "I'm going to get him arrested myself, don't worry.", 
"co_1461": "Did you not understand anything I showed you at all?", 
"co_1462": "These people are too dangerous, they won't \nthink twice before hurting you.", 
"co_1463": "I don't care, I'll do this for you.", 
"co_1464": "Michael will be caught sooner or later, don't put \nyourself at foolish risks.", 
"co_1465": "I'm already out of the game, there's no reason for you to lose \neverything because of a dead man.", 
"co_1466": "All this years, and you still can't tell?", 
"co_1467": "What?", 
"co_1468": "Y-you and Ellen were everything I had.", 
"co_14688": "My whole life I have been bought and sold like freaking \ncattle because of my skills.",
"co_1468x": "You and Ellen were the first people not to treat me as an asset.",
"co_1468y": "You two were the closest thing I've ever had to a family, \nand now you're both gone.",     
"co_1469": "What else is there for me to lose now?", 
"co_1470": "I already made up my mind 5 minutes ago.", 
"co_1471": "Now it's up to you to decide if you're going to help me \nget his ass arrested or not.", 
"co_1472": "I can never win against you, can I?", 
"co_1473": "I already told you, I'm your partner, damnit.", 
"co_1474": "If that's what you want, we're in this together.", 
"co_1475": "I'm glad you know it, idiot.", 
"co_1476": "I have an idea, the day I went to the Banks & Co. building... \nI took several pictures of them at the crime scene!", 
"co_1477": "But I freaked out when they found me, and ended up leaving \nmy cell phone inside the ventilation ducts.", 
"co_1478": "I believe you can safely retrieve it, there's probably \nno one there today.", 
"co_1479": "Alright, let's go to the place then.", 
"co_1480": "But make it snap, and don't talk to anyone on your way there.", 
"co_1481": "Michael has informants everywhere, he'll see you coming.",
"co_1481x": "And one last thing, the bastard is smarter than he looks.",

"co_1614": "I feel majestic sparkling like this.", 
"co_1615": "I was almost forgetting about the seance, let's do it?", 
"co_1616": "Yeah, I want to remember exactly what \nthose bastards did.",

"co_1722": "No, killing him'd be too nice, I'll make him rot in \nprison, along with Caroline and Frederick.",

"co_1876": "Also, no more killing from now on... \nWe'll start doing things differently here!", 
"co_1877": "And don't ever expect me to be your friend, \nI'm only in this because Kenny said so.", 
"co_1878": "I am really grateful to hear this from you, Madam.",

"co_2004": "Hopeless, she no longer opposed the cult's interests.", 
"co_2005": "All she could do now was to observe the rise of a new world order.", 
"co_2006": "A sanguinary world order that she reluctantly helped create.", 
"co_2007": "The power also ended up corrupting Mia, who became Michael's right hand \nwithin the brotherhood.", 
"co_2008": "Indeed, she never became their queen as Michael had promised, but she \ncertainly didn't care about it.", 
"co_2009": "All she could think about was what their next big step would be.", 
    "co_2009a": "How they'd act to expand the brotherhood to the four corners of the world.", 
"co_2010": "Proudly, Michael'd observe his partner, as she talks passionately about their goals.",

"co_2012": "Convinced by Kennedy, Mia ended up accepting Michael's proposal.", 
"co_2013": "Although Mia initially showed resistance, she started to work for \nthe brotherhood by doing Seances for them.", 
"co_2014": "Hey, Mia, how about a little break?", 
"co_2015": "I want to enjoy each bite of my shitty ten dollar hot dog.", 
"co_2016": "Sorry, pal, if we sit down we won't see the whole park today!", 
"co_2017": "Mia, come see this!", 
"co_2018": "This must be the best Machina plush I've ever seen...", 
"co_2019": "Wow, what an ugly-ass toy!", 
"co_2020": "Now let's keep going.", 
"co_2021": "Hey, it's not any plush, it's from Tier Automata!", 
"co_2022": "Also known as one of the best games ever made!",

"co_2024": "What?",

"co_2029": "$30 for a go?!", 
"co_2030": "Bro, it's like this place it's a big, big Venus flytrap.", 
"co_2031": "And I were a clueless little fly lured here by you, Mia!", 
"co_2032": "You either get me this plush or I quit my job.",

"co_2034": "Fine, let's do this!",

"co_2039": "Hooray, so much fun!", 
"co_2040": "Now let's go.", 
"co_2041": "Nah, I don't think so, try one more time!", 
"co_2042": "Are you out of your mind?", 
"co_2043": "This garbage game is obviously rigged, I'm sure there \nweren't thirty moles to hit!", 
"co_2044": "Kenny, I think I'll send my CV to Victoria Secrets!", 
"co_2045": "I heard they give Company Store Discounts to their\nemployees, Isn't that amazing?", 
"co_2046": "Kennedy gave the tent clerk another thirty dollars.", 
"co_2047": "Okay, let me try that again, mister.", 
"co_2048": "Hmm, know what? \nI don't feel like working next month.", 
"co_2049": "Whoa, is that Leonardo DiCaprio over there?", 
"co_2050": "                           No way, where?", 
"co_2051": "Kennedy passed a fifty dollar bill on the counter to the tent clerk.", 
"co_2052": "Just give me the plush, good sir.", 
"co_2053": "Tent clerk: Sorry sir, but I'm only allowed to hand the plushies \nwhen someone wins at the game.", 
"co_2054": "Hand me the goddamn plush or I'll arrest every single one \nof you for price gouging, I swear to God.", 
"co_2055": "There's no one there who even resembles Dicaprio, \nI think you need glasses! ", 
"co_2056": "This explains why he sucks so much at Whack-a-mole.", 
"co_2057": "Look, Mia, I got the doll!", 
"co_2058": "It seems that the game had a problem with the counter.", 
"co_2059": "No way, you are the best, dude!", 
"co_2060": "You do know that he threatened the tent guy, right?", 
"co_2061": "Sure, but let's let him have this one win.", 
"co_2062": "Now how about we go to...", 
"co_2063": "                           Hey Mia, come see this!", 
"co_2064": "                           Oh my God, Kenny, come over here!", 
"co_2065": "Fuck my life.", 
"co_2066": "Hey boss, what's up?", 
"co_2067": "Hello there, I hope I'm not disturbing you guys!", 
"co_2068": "Of course not, you're saving me!", 
"co_2069": "Hmm, okay? \nI have a case that you might be interested in, \nhow about dropping by?", 
"co_2070": "Absolutely, just send me your location and we'll be there.", 
"co_2071": "Excellent, and please bring an insect repellent for me. \nThe place's kinda in the middle of nowhere!", 
"co_2072": "Got it, see you soon boss!", 
"co_2073": "Mia, let's go, we have a case far from town today.", 
"co_2074": "I don't know how I'm supposed to go on living \nwithout this plush anymore.", 
"co_2075": "Good grief.", 
"co_2076": "Kennedy took the badge out of his pocket and approached the tent clerk.", 
"co_2077": "Smack 30 moles under 15 seconds to win the prize!", 
"co_2078": "Hey Kenny, let's check what's that shining thing on stage.", 
"co_2079": "Alright.", 
"co_2080": "A man enters a popular restaurant in his city.", 
"co_2081": "He places a single order: Pheasant meat. \nAnd after taking a single bite of it...", 
"co_2082": "BOOM! \nThe man kills himself!", 
"co_2083": "Why does everyone die in these?", 
"co_2084": "Fine, let me think...", 
"co_2085": "Was he alone?", 
"co_2086": "Where is he?", 
"co_2087": "Was this guy alone at the restaurant?",  
"co_2088": "Yes, and this question is quite relevant, by the way.", 
"co_2089": "In what city does the story take place?", 
"co_2090": "Irrelevant.", 
"co_2091": "So he was supposed to be with someone...", 
"co_2092": "His wife", 
"co_2093": "His brother", 
"co_2094": "His friend", 
"co_2095": "Should he be with his wife?",       
"co_2096": "Should he be with his brother?", 
"co_2097": "Should he be with his friend?", 
"co_2098": "She stood him up?", 
"co_2099": "She suffered an accident?",       
"co_2100": "Well, technically yes, but I will say no to this one so I don't get \nyou all confused.", 
"co_2101": "Affirmative!", 
"co_2102": "Did he cause the accident?", 
"co_2103": "Was he in the accident?",         
"co_2104": "Now, what kind of accident...", 
"co_2105": "Plane?", 
"co_2106": "Ship?",        
"co_2107": "Car?", 
"co_2108": "Was it a plane crash?", 
"co_2109": "Was it a cruise wreck?",      
"co_2110": "Was it a car crash?", 
"co_2111": "Capsize?", 
"co_2112": "Where did they shipwreck?",      
"co_2113": "Did the cruise capsize?", 
"co_2114": "Did they shipwreck on an island?",      
"co_2115": "How long they stayed there?",     
"co_2116": "Phone signal?", 
"co_2117": "Did they stay on the island for more than a month?", 
"co_2118": "Did they have phone signal on the island?", 
"co_2119": "Food and water?", 
"co_2120": "More than a month, then I presume they had a supply of food and water?",  
"co_2121": "This kinda counts as two questions, but I'll be nice and answer as one:", 
"co_2122": "Yes, they had water, but no food supply.", 
"co_2123": "So how did they feed everyone for a month?", 
"co_2124": "Fishing?", 
"co_2125": "Hunting?", 
"co_2126": "Did the group start fishing to feed everyone?", 
"co_2127": "Nope, no fish there.", 
"co_2128": "Did they start eating pheasant meat to survive?",  
"co_2129": "Yes and no at the same time.", 
"co_2130": "Are you kidding me?", 
"co_2131": "You are doing well, but this is your last question, so think carefully!", 
"co_2132": "So the guy shoots himself after eating pheasant.", 
"co_2133": "After a shipwreck, he ended up on an island with \nhis wife and a group of people.", 
"co_2134": "I never said that his wife was there.", 
"co_2135": "What, she went missing after the wreck?!", 
"co_2136": "Oops, I wasn't supposed to say that, you're welcome!", 
"co_2137": "So the guy was stuck with some people and no food on the island...", 
"co_2138": "Then they started eating pheasant and didn't at the same time?!", 
"co_2139": "What the heck is that supposed to mean?", 
"co_2140": "Were there pheasants there?", 
"co_2141": "Oh, hell no!", 
"co_2142": "Were there pheasants on the island?", 
"co_2143": "Nope, not a single pheasant on there!", 
"co_2144": "The man was stuck on the island with the group for weeks, \nthey tried to go after food, but failed!", 
"co_2145": "Then they started feeding the group with human flesh, \nfrom the victims of the shipwreck!", 
"co_2146": "They convinced the group to eat the strange meat by saying \nit was pheasant meat!", 
"co_2147": "Once he was rescued and back in civilization, the \nskeptical man went to taste real pheasant meat.", 
"co_2148": "When he found out that what they served him on the island \nwas not pheasant, but human flesh, maybe even his wife's...", 
"co_2149": "He just couldn't take it, and ended up killing himself, \nis that it?", 
"co_2150": "Holy cow, you are good at this!", 
"co_2151": "I didn't become a detective only because I'm handsome, girl.", 
"co_2152": "Oh shit, I think I got it!", 
"co_2153": "The one of the pheasant, I beg you!", 
"co_2154": "Alright, pheasant it is!", 
"co_2155": "This one is crazy, so pay attention:", 
"co_2156": "Nope!", 
"co_2157": "Now, why on earth wouldn't she be there?", 
"co_2158": "His wife wasn't there because... Of an accident?", 
"co_2159": "His wife wasn't there because... She stood him up?", 
"co_2160": "Now, about the circumstances of the accident.", 
"co_2161": "Damn, this one is hard.", 
"co_2162": "Try to bribe Mia.", 
"co_2163": "Hey, how about I exchange two salmon sashimis for a hint?", 
"co_2164": "I'll have a Tuna Niguiri, too!", 
"co_2165": "Deal.", 
"co_2166": "Okay, so the group had plenty of water to drink, but no food!", 
"co_2167": "Bro, this one gives me the goosebumps every time that I hear it!", 
"co_2168": "Try to bribe Mia again", 
"co_2169": "The man loved pheasants?", 
"co_2170": "Uhh, did the man love pheasants so much that he refused to eat them?", 
"co_2171": "No, Kenny, how the hell did you conclude this?", 
"co_2172": "What about the pheasants?", 
"co_2173": "Seventh question", 
"co_2174": "What does the guy have to do with this?", 
"co_2175": "Was the man also present at the accident?", 
"co_2176": "Did the man cause the accident?",
